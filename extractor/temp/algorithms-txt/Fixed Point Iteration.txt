FULL TEXT
In numerical analysis, fixed-point iteration is a method of computing fixed points of iterated functions.
More specifically, given a function 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 defined on the real numbers with real values and given a point 




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}

 in the domain of 



f


{\displaystyle f}

, the fixed point iteration is
which gives rise to the sequence 




x

0


,

x

1


,

x

2


,
â€¦


{\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\dots }

 which is hoped to converge to a point 



x


{\displaystyle x}

. If 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 is continuous, then one can prove that the obtained 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 is a fixed point of 



f


{\displaystyle f}

, i.e.,
More generally, the function 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 can be defined on any metric space with values in that same space.


converges to 0 for all values of 




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}

. However, 0 is not a fixed point of the function
as this function is not continuous at 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

, and in fact has no fixed points.
