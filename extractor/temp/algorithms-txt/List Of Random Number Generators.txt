Computer random number generators are important in mathematics, cryptography and gambling (on game servers).
This list includes many common types, regardless of quality.


The following algorithms are pseudorandom number generators:
The following is a list of companies that produce hardware random number generators:
You may download true random numbers from these sites:
You may generate pseudo-random numbers from these sites:
Note: random numbers transferred over the public internet are not cryptographically secure for most purposes.
Cipher algorithms and cryptographic hashes can also be used as pseudorandom number generators. These include:
