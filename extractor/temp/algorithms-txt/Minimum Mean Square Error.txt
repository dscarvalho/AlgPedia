ABOUT
In statistics and signal processing, a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is an estimation method which minimizes the mean square error (MSE), which is a common measure of estimator quality, of the fitted values of a dependent variable. In the Bayesian setting, the term MMSE more specifically refers to estimation with quadratic cost function. In such case, the MMSE estimator is given by the posterior mean of the parameter to be estimated. Since the posterior mean is cumbersome to calculate, the form of the MMSE estimator is usually constrained to be within a certain class of functions. Linear MMSE estimators are a popular choice since they are easy to use, calculate, and very versatile.

In statistics and signal processing, a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is an estimation method which minimizes the mean square error (MSE), which is a common measure of estimator quality, of the fitted values of a dependent variable. In the Bayesian setting, the term MMSE more specifically refers to estimation with quadratic cost function. In such case, the MMSE estimator is given by the posterior mean of the parameter to be estimated. Since the posterior mean is cumbersome to calculate, the form of the MMSE estimator is usually constrained to be within a certain class of functions. Linear MMSE estimators are a popular choice since they are easy to use, calculate, and very versatile. It has given rise to many popular estimators such as the Wiener-Kolmogorov filter and Kalman filter.


The term MMSE more specifically refers to estimation in a Bayesian setting with quadratic cost function. The basic idea behind the Bayesian approach to estimation stems from practical situations where we often have some prior information about the parameter to be estimated. For instance, we may have prior information about the range that the parameter can assume; or we may have an old estimate of the parameter that we want to modify when a new observation is made available; or the statistics of an actual random signal such as speech. This is in contrast to the non-Bayesian approach like minimum-variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) where absolutely nothing is assumed to be known about the parameter in advance and which does not account for such situations. In the Bayesian approach, such prior information is captured by the prior probability density function of the parameters; and based directly on Bayes theorem, it allows us to make better posterior estimates as more observations become available. Thus unlike non-Bayesian approach where parameters of interest are assumed to be deterministic, but unknown constants, the Bayesian estimator seeks to estimate a parameter that is itself a random variable. Furthermore, Bayesian estimation can also deal with situations where the sequence of observations are not necessarily independent. Thus Bayesian estimation provides yet another alternative to the MVUE. This is useful when the MVUE does not exist or cannot be found.
Let 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 be a 



n

1


{\displaystyle n\times 1}

 hidden random vector variable, and let 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 be a 



m
×
1


{\displaystyle m\times 1}

 known random vector variable (the measurement or observation), both of them not necessarily of the same dimension. An estimator 






x
^



(
y
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}(y)}

 of 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 is any function of the measurement 



y


{\displaystyle y}

. The estimation error vector is given by 



e
=



x
^



−
x


{\displaystyle e={\hat {x}}-x}

 and its mean squared error (MSE) is given by the trace of error covariance matrix
where the expectation 




E



{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} }

 is taken over both 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 and 



y


{\displaystyle y}

. When 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 is a scalar variable, the MSE expression simplifies to 




E


{
(



x

−
x

)

2


}



{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} \left\{({\hat {x}}-x)^{2}\right\}}

. Note that MSE can equivalently be defined in other ways, since
The MMSE estimator is then defined as the estimator achieving minimal MSE:
In many cases, it is not possible to determine the analytical expression of the MMSE estimator. Two basic numerical approaches to obtain the MMSE estimate depends on either finding the conditional expectation 




E

{
x

|

y
}


{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} \{x|y\}}

 or finding the minima of MSE. Direct numerical evaluation of the conditional expectation is computationally expensive, since they often require multidimensional integration usually done via Monte Carlo methods. Another computational approach is to directly seek the minima of the MSE using techniques such as the gradient descent methods; but this method still requires the evaluation of expectation. While these numerical methods have been fruitful, a closed form expression for the MMSE estimator is nevertheless possible if we are willing to make some compromises.
One possibility is to abandon the full optimality requirements and seek a technique minimizing the MSE within a particular class of estimators, such as the class of linear estimators. Thus we postulate that the conditional expectation of 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 given 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 is a simple linear function of 



y


{\displaystyle y}

, 




E

{
x

|

y
}
=
W
y
+
b


{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} \{x|y\}=Wy+b}

, where the measurement 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 is a random vector, 



W


{\displaystyle W}

 is a matrix and 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 is a vector. This can be seen as the first order Taylor approximation of 




E

{
x

|

y
}


{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} \{x|y\}}

. The linear MMSE estimator is the estimator achieving minimum MSE among all estimators of such form. That is, it solves the following the optimization problem:
One advantage of such linear MMSE estimator is that it is not necessary to explicitly calculate the posterior probability density function of 



x


{\displaystyle x}

. Such linear estimator only depends on the first two moments of 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 and 



y


{\displaystyle y}

. So although it may be convenient to assume that 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 and 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 are jointly Gaussian, it is not necessary to make this assumption, so long as the assumed distribution has well defined first and second moments. The form of the linear estimator does not depend on the type of the assumed underlying distribution.
The expression for optimal 



b

W


{\displaystyle W}

Thus the expression for linear MMSE estimator, its mean, and its auto-covariance is given by
where the

{\displaystyle C_{YX}}

Lastly, the error covariance and minimum mean square error achievable by such estimator is
For the special case when both 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 and 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 are scalars, the above relations simplify to
Let us have the optimal linear MMSE estimator given as

{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}=Wy+b}

, where we are required to find the expression for

 and 



b

. It is required that the MMSE estimator be unbiased. This means,
Plugging the expression for 






x

{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}

 in above, we get

{\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=\mathrm {E} \{x\}}

 and 






y

{\displaystyle {\bar {y}}=\mathrm {E} \{y\}}

. Thus we can re-write the estimator as
and the expression for estimation error becomes
From the orthogonality principle, we can have

{\displaystyle g(y)=y-{\bar {y}}}

When equated to zero, we obtain the desired expression for 



W

 as
The 




C

Y




{\displaystyle C_{XY}}

T




{\displaystyle C_{XY}=C_{YX}^{T}}

, the expression can also be re-written in terms of

Thus the full expression for the linear MMSE estimator is
Since the estimate

{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}

 is itself a random variable with 




E

{

{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} \{{\hat {x}}\}={\bar {x}}}

, we can also obtain its auto-covariance as
Putting the expression for 



W


{\displaystyle W}

 and 




W

T




{\displaystyle W^{T}}

, we get
Lastly, the covariance of linear MMSE estimation error will then be given by
The first term in the third line is zero due to the orthogonality principle. Since

{\displaystyle W=C_{XY}C_{Y}^{-1}}

{\displaystyle C_{e}=C_{X}-C_{\hat {X}}.}

 Thus the minimum mean square error achievable by such a linear estimator is
Standard method like Gauss elimination can be used to solve the matrix equation for 



W


{\displaystyle W}

. A more numerically stable method is provided by QR decomposition method. Since the matrix 




C

Y




{\displaystyle C_{Y}}

 is a symmetric positive definite matrix, 



W


{\displaystyle W}

 can be solved twice as fast with the Cholesky decomposition, while for large sparse systems conjugate gradient method is more effective. Levinson recursion is a fast method when 




C

Y




{\displaystyle C_{Y}}

 is also a Toeplitz matrix. This can happen when 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 is a wide sense stationary process. In such stationary cases, these estimators are also referred to as Wiener-Kolmogorov filters.
Let us further model the underlying process of observation as a linear process: 



y
=
A
x
+
z


{\displaystyle y=Ax+z}

, where 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is a known matrix and 



z


{\displaystyle z}

 is random noise vector with the mean 




E

{\displaystyle \mathrm {E} \{z\}=0}

 and cross-covariance 




C

Z


=

{\displaystyle C_{XZ}=0}

. Here the required mean and the covariance matrices will be
Thus the expression for the linear MMSE estimator matrix 



W


{\displaystyle W}

 further modifies to
Putting everything into the expression for 






x
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}

, we get
Lastly, the error covariance is
The significant difference between the estimation problem treated above and those of least squares and Gauss-Markov estimate is that the number of observations m, (i.e. the dimension of 



y


{\displaystyle y}

) need not be at least as large as the number of unknowns, n, (i.e. the dimension of 



x


{\displaystyle x}

). The estimate for the linear observation process exists so long as the m-by-m matrix 



(
A

C

X



A

T


+

C

Z



)

−
1




{\displaystyle (AC_{X}A^{T}+C_{Z})^{-1}}

 exists; this is the case for any m if, for instance, 




C

Z




{\displaystyle C_{Z}}

 is positive definite. Physically the reason for this property is that since 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 is now a random variable, it is possible to form a meaningful estimate (namely its mean) even with no measurements. Every new measurement simply provides additional information which may modify our original estimate. Another feature of this estimate is that for m < n, there need be no measurement error. Thus, we may have 




C

Z


=
0


{\displaystyle C_{Z}=0}

, because as long as 



A

C

X



A

T




{\displaystyle AC_{X}A^{T}}

 is positive definite, the estimate still exists. Lastly, this technique can handle cases where the noise is correlated.
An alternative form of expression can be obtained by using the matrix identity
which can be established by post-multiplying by 



(
A

C

X



A

T

C

Z


)


{\displaystyle (AC_{X}A^{T}+C_{Z})}

)
,


{\displaystyle (A^{T}C_{Z}^{-1}A+C_{X}^{-1}),}

 to obtain
and
Since

 as 



W

−

{\displaystyle W=C_{e}A^{T}C_{Z}^{-1}}

, we get a simplified expression for 






x

{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}

 as
In this form the above expression can be easily compared with weighed least square and Gauss-Markov estimate. In particular, when 




C

{\displaystyle C_{X}^{-1}=0}

, corresponding to infinite variance of the apriori information concerning

A

{\displaystyle W=(A^{T}C_{Z}^{-1}A)^{-1}A^{T}C_{Z}^{-1}}

{\displaystyle C_{Z}^{-1}}

 as the weight matrix. Moreover, if the components of 



z


{\displaystyle z}

 are uncorrelated and have equal variance such that 




C

I
,


{\displaystyle C_{Z}=\sigma ^{2}I,}

{\displaystyle W=(A^{T}A)^{-1}A^{T}}

 is identical to the ordinary least square estimate.
In many real-time application, observational data is not available in a single batch. Instead the observations are made in a sequence. A naive application of previous formulas would have us discard an old estimate and recompute a new estimate as fresh data is made available. But then we lose all information provided by the old observation. When the observations are scalar quantities, one possible way of avoiding such re-computation is to first concatenate the entire sequence of observations and then apply the standard estimation formula as done in Example 2. But this can be very tedious because as the number of observation increases so does the size of the matrices that need to be inverted and multiplied grow. Also, this method is difficult to extend to the case of vector observations. Another approach to estimation from sequential observations is to simply update an old estimate as additional data becomes available, leading to finer estimates. Thus a recursive method is desired where the new measurements can modify the old estimates. Implicit in these discussions is the assumption that the statistical properties of 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 does not change with time. In other words, 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 is stationary.
For sequential estimation, if we have an estimate 







x
^




1




{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}_{1}}

 based on measurements generating space 




Y

1




{\displaystyle Y_{1}}

, then after receiving another set of measurements, we should subtract out from these measurements that part that could be anticipated from the result of the first measurements. In other words, the updating must be based on that part of the new data which is orthogonal to the old data.
Suppose an optimal estimate 







x
^

{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}_{1}}

 has been formed on the basis of past measurements and that error covariance matrix is 




C


e

{\displaystyle C_{e_{1}}}

. For linear observation processes the best estimate of

 based on past observation, and hence old estimate

, is

{\displaystyle {\hat {y}}=A{\hat {x}}_{1}}

 from

The new estimate based on additional data is now
where

{\displaystyle C_{X{\tilde {Y}}}}

 and

{\displaystyle x={\hat {x}}_{1}+e_{1}}

, we can obtain the covariance matrices in terms of error covariance as
Putting everything together, we have the new estimate as
and the new error covariance as
The repeated use of the above two equations as more observations become available lead to recursive estimation techniques. The expressions can be more compactly written as
The matrix 



K


{\displaystyle K}

 is often referred to as the gain factor. The repetition of these three steps as more data becomes available leads to an iterative estimation algorithm. The generalization of this idea to non-stationary cases gives rise to the Kalman filter.
As an important special case, an easy to use recursive expression can be derived when at each m-th time instant the underlying linear observation process yields a scalar such that

 is n-by-1 random column vector to be estimated, and 




z

{\displaystyle z_{m}}

{\displaystyle \sigma _{m}^{2}}

. After (m+1)-th observation, the direct use of above recursive equations give the expression for the estimate

 as:

Here no matrix inversion is required. Also the gain factor 




k

{\displaystyle k_{m+1}}

 depends on our confidence in the new data sample, as measured by the noise variance, versus that in the previous data. The initial values of 






x

 and 




C

e




{\displaystyle C_{e}}

 are taken to be the mean and covariance of the aprior probability density function of 



x


{\displaystyle x}

.
This important special case has also given rise to many other iterative methods (or adaptive filters), such as the least mean squares filter and recursive least squares filter, that directly solves the original MSE optimization problem using gradient descent methods. These methods bypass the need for covariance matrices.
We shall take a linear prediction problem as an example. Let a linear combination of observed scalar random variables

Similarly, the variance of the estimator is

 and the LMMSE of the estimate will tend to zero.
However, the estimator is suboptimal since it is constrained to be linear. Had the random variable 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 also been Gaussian, then the estimator would have been optimal. Notice, that the form of the estimator will remain unchanged, regardless of the apriori distribution of

 Note that except for the mean and variance of the error, the error distribution is unspecified. How should the two polls be combined to obtain the voting prediction for the given candidate?
As with previous example, we have

{\displaystyle y_{2}}

 as
where the weights are given by
Here since the denominator term is constant, the poll with lower error is given higher weight in order to predict the election outcome. Lastly, the variance of the prediction is given by

Suppose that a musician is playing an instrument and that the sound is received by two microphones, each of them located at two different places. Let the attenuation of sound due to distance at each microphone be 




a

{\displaystyle a_{1}}

 and 




a

{\displaystyle a_{2}}

, which are assumed to be known constants. Similarly, let the noise at each microphone be

{\displaystyle z_{1}}

 and 




z

{\displaystyle z_{2}}

, each with zero mean and variances

 How should the recorded music from these two microphones be combined, after being synced with each other?
We can model the sound received by each microphone as
Here both the
