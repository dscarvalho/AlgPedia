FULL TEXT
Ordicate is a term which means to put a series of data in numerical order.
In order for a set of data to be ordicated, the data must first be enumerated.
For example, imagine a class of twenty students taking an exam. The order in which the students hand in the exam is the order in which the professor grades the test. The professor enumerates the exams by placing a score from 0 to 100 on them. Then, when the teacher hands back the exams, he or she has arranged the exams from lowest to highest (or highest to lowest) score.
This is ordication: the professor ordered the exams by their numerical value.
