PYTHIA is a computer simulation program for particle collisions at very high energies (see event (particle physics)) in particle accelerators.


PYTHIA was originally written in FORTRAN 77, until the 2007 release of PYTHIA 8.1 which was rewritten in C++. Both the Fortran and C++ versions are being maintained because not all components were merged into the 8.1 version.
