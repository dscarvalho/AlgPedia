ABOUT
In applied mathematics, the non-uniform discrete Fourier transform (NDFT) of a signal is a type of Fourier transform, related to a discrete Fourier transform or discrete-time Fourier transform, but in which the input signal is not sampled at equally spaced intervals. As a result of this, the computed Discrete Fourier Transform can also consist of unevenly sampled frequency values. It is however also possible to compute uniformly sampled frequency values from an unevenly sampled input signal.

In applied mathematics, the non-uniform discrete Fourier transform (NDFT) of a signal is a type of Fourier transform, related to a discrete Fourier transform or discrete-time Fourier transform, but in which the input signal is not sampled at equally spaced intervals. As a result of this, the computed Discrete Fourier Transform can also consist of unevenly sampled frequency values. It is however also possible to compute uniformly sampled frequency values from an unevenly sampled input signal.
As a generalized approach for nonuniform sampling, NDFT allows one to obtain frequency domain information of a finite length signal at any frequency. It can also be used to design the FIR filters as the role of DFT, no matter if it's 1-D or 2-D.
One of the reasons to adopt NDFT is that many signals have their energy distributed nonuniformly in the frequency domain. Therefore, a nonuniform sampling scheme could be more convenient and useful in many Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications. For example, NDFT provides a variable spectral resolution controlled by the user.
Note that NDFT reduces to DFT when the sampling points are located on the unit circle at equally spaced angles.

where
As we can see, the NDFT is characterized by

Given

then x[n] is the coefficients of the above interpolating polynomial which can be solved more efficiently. This is illustrated in the next subsection.

The disadvantage of Lagrange representation is that any additional point included will increase the order of the interpolating polynomial, leading to the need of recomputing all the fundamental polynomials. However, any additional point included in Newton representation only require one more term.
We can use a lower triangular system to solve

As in the 1-D case, we can express the above equation as
