{\displaystyle A=K[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{s}]}

 be a commutative polynomial ring (with

 when

{\displaystyle A[\partial _{1};\sigma _{1},\delta _{1}]\cdots [\partial _{r};\sigma _{r},\delta _{r}]}

 is called an Ore algebra when the 




σ

i




{\displaystyle \sigma _{i}}

 and 




δ

j




{\displaystyle \delta _{j}}

 commute for 



i
≠

{\displaystyle i\neq j}

, and satisfy

)
=

{\displaystyle \sigma _{i}(\partial _{j})=\partial _{j}}

δ

(

)
=
0


{\displaystyle \delta _{i}(\partial _{j})=0}

 for 



i

{\displaystyle i>j}

.
Ore algebras satisfy the Ore condition, and thus can be embedded in a (skew) field of fractions.
The constraint of commutation in the definition makes Ore algebras have a non-commutative generalization theory of Gröbner basis for their left ideals.
