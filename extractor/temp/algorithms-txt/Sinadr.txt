P


{\displaystyle P}

 is the average power of the signal, quantization error, random noise and distortion components. SINADR is usually expressed in dB. SINADR is a standard metric for analog-to-digital converter and digital-to-analog converter.
SINADR (in dB) is related to ENOB by the following equation:
