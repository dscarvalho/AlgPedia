In mathematics and computer science, truncation is limiting the number of digits right of the decimal point.


Truncation of positive real numbers can be done using the floor function. Given a number 



x
∈


R


+




{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} _{+}}

 to be truncated and 



n
∈


N


0




{\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} _{0}}

, the number of elements to be kept behind the decimal point, the truncated value of x is
However, for negative numbers truncation does not round in the same direction as the floor function: truncation always rounds toward zero, the floor function rounds towards negative infinity. This function ist used instead of
for a given number 



x
∈


R


−




{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} _{-}}

.
With computers, truncation can occur when a decimal number is typecast as an integer; it is truncated to zero decimal digits because integers cannot store non-integer real numbers.
An analogue of truncation can be applied to polynomials. In this case, the truncation of a polynomial P to degree n can be defined as the sum of all terms of P of degree n or less. Polynomial truncations arise in the study of Taylor polynomials, for example.[1]
