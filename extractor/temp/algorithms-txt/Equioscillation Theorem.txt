Let 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 be a continuous function from 



[

]


{\displaystyle [a,b]}

 to 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} }

. Among all the polynomials of degree 



≤
n


{\displaystyle \leq n}

, the polynomial 



g


{\displaystyle g}

 minimizes the uniform norm of the difference

Several minimax approximation algorithms are available, the most common being the Remez algorithm.
