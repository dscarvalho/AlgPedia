Amplitude amplification is a technique in quantum computing which generalizes the idea behind the Grover's search algorithm, and gives rise to a family of quantum algorithms. It was discovered by Gilles Brassard and Peter Høyer in 1997, [1] and independently rediscovered by Lov Grover in 1998. [2]
In a quantum computer, amplitude amplification can be used to obtain a quadratic speedup over several classical algorithms.
The derivation presented here roughly follows the one given in .[3] Assume we have an N-dimensional Hilbert space 





H




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}

 representing the state space of our quantum system, spanned by the orthonormal computational basis states

{\displaystyle B:=\{|k\rangle \}_{k=0}^{N-1}}

. Furthermore assume we have a Hermitian projection operator

{\displaystyle P:{\mathcal {H}}\to {\mathcal {H}}}

 may be given in terms of a Boolean oracle function

, in which case




P


{\displaystyle P}

 can be used to partition 





H




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}

 into a direct sum of two mutually orthogonal subspaces, the good subspace 






H

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{1}}

 and the bad subspace 






H

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{0}}

:
Given a normalized state vector

ψ

H




{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle \in {\mathcal {H}}}

 which has nonzero overlap with both subspaces, we can uniquely decompose it as

{\displaystyle |\psi _{1}\rangle }

 and

{\displaystyle |\psi _{0}\rangle }

 are the normalized projections of

{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }

 into the subspaces

 and

rotating the state between the good and bad subspaces. After

{\displaystyle \sin ^{2}((2n+1)\theta )\,\!}

The probability is maximized if we choose
Up until this point each iteration increases the amplitude of the good states, hence the name of the technique.
Assume we have an unsorted database with N elements, and an oracle function 



χ


{\displaystyle \chi }

 which can recognize the good entries we are searching for, and 




B

op


=
B


{\displaystyle B_{\text{op}}=B}

 for simplicity.
If there are 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 such entries in the database in total, then we can find them by initializing the quantum computer into a uniform superposition
of all the database elements, and running the above algorithm. In this case the overlap of the initial state with the good subspace is equal to the square root of the frequency of the good entries in the database,

. If

{\displaystyle \sin(\theta )\ll 1}

, we can approximate the number of required iterations as
Measuring the state will now give one of the good entries with a high probability. Since each application of 




S

P




{\displaystyle S_{P}}

 requires a single oracle query (assuming that the oracle is implemented as a quantum gate), we can find a good entry with just 



O

)


{\displaystyle O({\sqrt {N}})}

 oracle queries, thus obtaining a quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm.
If we set 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 to one, the above scenario essentially reduces to the original Grover search.
