ABOUT
Augmented tree-based routing (ATR) protocol, first proposed in Augmented Tree-based Routing Protocol for Scalable Ad Hoc Networks, Proc. of IEEE MHWMN'07: The Third IEEE International Workshop on Heterogeneous Multi-Hop Wireless and mobile networks 2007, Pisa (Italy), October 2007, is a multi-path DHT-based routing protocol for scalable networks. ATR resorts to an augmented tree-based address space structure and a hierarchical multi-path routing protocol in order to gain scalability and good resilience against node failure/mobility and link congestion/instability.
