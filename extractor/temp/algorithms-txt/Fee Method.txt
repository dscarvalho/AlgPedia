A class of functions, which are 'similar to the exponential function' was given the name 'E-functions' by Siegel.[3] Among these functions are such special functions as the hypergeometric function, cylinder, spherical functions and so on.
Using the FEE, it is possible to prove the following theorem
Theorem: Let 



y
=
f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle y=f(x)}

 be an elementary Transcendental function, that is the exponential function, or a trigonometric function, or an elementary algebraic function, or their superposition, or their inverse, or a superposition of the inverses. Then

The algorithms based on the method FEE include the algorithms for fast calculation of any elementary Transcendental function for any value of the argument, the classical constants e,

At present,[when?] only the FEE makes it possible to calculate fast the values of the functions from the class of higher transcendental functions,[11] certain special integrals of mathematical physics and such classical constants as Euler's, Catalan's[12] and Apéry's constants. An additional advantage of the method FEE is the possibility of parallelizing the algorithms based on the FEE.
