In computational group theory, a black box group (black-box group) is a group G whose elements are encoded by bit strings of length N, and group operations are performed by an oracle (the "black box"). These operations include:
• taking a product g·h of elements g and h,
• taking an inverse g−1 of element g,
• deciding whether g = 1.
This class is defined to include both the permutation groups and the matrix groups. The upper bound on the order of G given by |G| ≤ 2N shows that G is finite.


The black box groups were introduced by Babai and Szemerédi in 1984. They were used as a formalism for (constructive) group recognition and property testing. Notable algorithms include the Babai's algorithm for finding random group elements,[1] the Product Replacement Algorithm,[2] and testing group commutativity.[3]
Many early algorithms in CGT, such as the Schreier–Sims algorithm, require a permutation representation of a group and thus are not black box. Many other algorithms require finding element orders. Since there are efficient ways of finding the order of an element in a permutation group or in a matrix group (a method for the latter is described by Celler and Leedham-Green in 1997), a common recourse is to assume that the black box group is equipped with a further oracle for determining element orders.[4]
