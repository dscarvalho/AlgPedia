Pairwise error probability is the error probability that for a transmitted signal (

) will be received. This type of probability is called ″pair-wise error probability″ because the probability exists with a pair of signal vectors in a signal constellation.[1] It's mainly used in communication systems.[1]


In general, the received signal is a distorted version of the transmitted signal. Thus, we introduce the symbol error probability, which is the probability

 based on the received symbol, which is defined as follows:
where M is the size of signal constellation.
The pairwise error probability

{\displaystyle P(X\to {\widehat {X}})}

 is defined as the probability that, when

 is received.
Using the upper bound to the probability of a union of events, it can be written:
Finally:
For the simple case of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel:
The PEP can be computed in closed form as follows:
