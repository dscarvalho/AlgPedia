ABOUT
The Legendre pseudospectral method for optimal control problems is based on Legendre polynomials. It is part of the larger theory of pseudospectral optimal control, a term coined by Ross.[1] A basic version of the Legendre pseudospectral method based on Gauss-Lobatto points was originally proposed by Elnagar and coworkers in 1995.[2] Since then, Ross, Fahroo and their co-workers[3][4] have extended, generalized and applied the method for a large range of problems.[5] An application that has received wide publicity[6] is the use of their method for generating real time trajectories for the International Space Station.

The Legendre pseudospectral method for optimal control problems is based on Legendre polynomials. It is part of the larger theory of pseudospectral optimal control, a term coined by Ross.[1] A basic version of the Legendre pseudospectral method based on Gauss-Lobatto points was originally proposed by Elnagar and coworkers in 1995.[2] Since then, Ross, Fahroo and their co-workers[3][4] have extended, generalized and applied the method for a large range of problems.[5] An application that has received wide publicity[6] is the use of their method for generating real time trajectories for the International Space Station.


The method was first implemented in DIDO in 2001.[7] Today, it is also available in other software packages such as OTIS and PSOPT.
The Legendre pseudospectral method has been implemented in flight by NASA several times. The first flight implementation was on November 5, 2006, when NASA used the Legendre pseudospectral method to maneuver the International Space Station to perform the Zero Propellant Maneuver. The Zero Propellant Maneuver was discovered by Nazereth Bedrossian using DIDO. Watch a video of this historic maneuver.
