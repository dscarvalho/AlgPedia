ABOUT
In optimization theory, semi-infinite programming (SIP) is an optimization problem with a finite number of variables and an infinite number of constraints, or an infinite number of variables and a finite number of constraints. In the former case the constraints are typically parameterized.[1]
FULL TEXT
In optimization theory, semi-infinite programming (SIP) is an optimization problem with a finite number of variables and an infinite number of constraints, or an infinite number of variables and a finite number of constraints. In the former case the constraints are typically parameterized.[1]


The problem can be stated simply as:
where
SIP can be seen as a special case of bilevel programs in which the lower-level variables do not participate in the objective function.
