Super Bit Mapping (SBM) is a noise shaping process, developed by Sony for CD mastering.[1]
Sony claims that the Super Bit Mapping process converts a 20-bit signal from master recording into a 16-bit signal nearly without sound quality loss, using noise shaping to improve signal to noise ratio over the frequency bands most acutely perceived by human hearing.[2]
Audible quantization error is reduced by noise shaping the error according to an equal-loudness contour.[3]
This processing takes place in dedicated hardware inside the recording device. A similar process is used in Sony's DSD to PCM conversion and is called SBM Direct.
