ABOUT
The spectral test is a statistical test for the quality of a class of pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), the linear congruential generators (LCGs).[1] As this test is devised to study the lattice structures of LCGs, it can not be applied to other families of PRNGs. According to Donald Knuth,[2] this is by far the most powerful test known, because it can fail LCGs which pass most statistical tests. The IBM subroutine RANDU[3] LCG fails in this test for 3 dimensions and above.
