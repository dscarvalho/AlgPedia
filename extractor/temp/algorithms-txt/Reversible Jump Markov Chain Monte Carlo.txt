In computational statistics, reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo is an extension to standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology that allows simulation of the posterior distribution on spaces of varying dimensions.[1] Thus, the simulation is possible even if the number of parameters in the model is not known.
Let
be a model indicator and 



M
=

⋃


n

m


=
1


I




R



d

m






{\displaystyle M=\bigcup _{n_{m}=1}^{I}\mathbb {R} ^{d_{m}}}

 the parameter space whose number of dimensions 




d

m




{\displaystyle d_{m}}

 depends on the model 




n

m




{\displaystyle n_{m}}

. The model indication need not be finite. The stationary distribution is the joint posterior distribution of 



(
M
,

N

m


)


{\displaystyle (M,N_{m})}

 that takes the values 



(
m
,

n

m


)


{\displaystyle (m,n_{m})}

.
The proposal 




m
′



{\displaystyle m'}

 can be constructed with a mapping 




g

m

m

{\displaystyle g_{1mm'}}

 of 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 and 



u


{\displaystyle u}

, where 



u


{\displaystyle u}

 is drawn from a random component 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 with density 



q


{\displaystyle q}

 on 





R



d

m

m
′







{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d_{mm'}}}

. The move to state 



(

m

,

n

m

′

)


{\displaystyle (m',n_{m}')}

 can thus be formulated as
The function
must be one to one and differentiable, and have a non-zero support:
so that there exists an inverse function
that is differentiable. Therefore, the 



(
m
,
u
)


{\displaystyle (m,u)}

 and 



(

m
′

,

u
′

)


{\displaystyle (m',u')}

 must be of equal dimension, which is the case if the dimension criterion
is met where 




d

m

m
′





{\displaystyle d_{mm'}}

 is the dimension of 



u


{\displaystyle u}

. This is known as dimension matching.
If 





R



d

m




⊂


R



d


m
′







{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d_{m}}\subset \mathbb {R} ^{d_{m'}}}

 then the dimensional matching condition can be reduced to
with
The acceptance probability will be given by
where 




|

⋅

|



{\displaystyle |\cdot |}

 denotes the absolute value and 




p

f

{\displaystyle p_{m}f_{m}}

 is the joint posterior probability
where 



c


{\displaystyle c}

 is the normalising constant.

There is an experimental RJ-MCMC tool available for the open source BUGs package.
