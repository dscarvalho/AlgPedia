In mathematics, minimum polynomial extrapolation is a sequence transformation used for convergence acceleration of vector sequences, due to Sabay and Jackson.[1]
While Aitken's method is the most famous, it often fails for vector sequences. An effective method for vector sequences is the minimum polynomial extrapolation. It is usually phrased in terms of the fixed point iteration:
Given iterates

{\displaystyle {\mathbb {R}}^{n}}

, one constructs the

{\displaystyle n\times (k-1)}

 whose columns are the
