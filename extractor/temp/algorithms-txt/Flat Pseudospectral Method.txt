FULL TEXT
The flat pseudospectral method is part of the family of the Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral methods introduced by Ross and Fahroo.[1] [2] The method combines the concept of differential flatness[3] [4] with pseudospectral method to generate outputs in the so-called flat space.
Because the differentiation matrix, 



D


{\displaystyle D}

, in a pseudospectral method is square, higher-order derivatives of any polynomial, 



y


{\displaystyle y}

, can be obtained by powers of 



D


{\displaystyle D}

,
where 



Y


{\displaystyle Y}

 is the pseudospectral variable and 



β


{\displaystyle \beta }

 is a finite positive integer. By differential flatness, there exists functions 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 and 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 such that the state and control variables can be written as,
The combination of these concepts generates the flat pseudospectral method; that is, x and u are written as,
Thus, an optimal control problem can be quickly and easily transformed to a problem with just the Y pseudospectral variable.[1]
