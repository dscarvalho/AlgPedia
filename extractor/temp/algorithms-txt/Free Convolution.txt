ABOUT
Free convolution is the free probability analog of the classical notion of convolution of probability measures. Due to the non-commutative nature of free probability theory, one has to talk separately about additive and multiplicative free convolution, which arise from addition and multiplication of free random variables (see below; in the classical case, what would be the analog of free multiplicative convolution can be reduced to additive convolution by passing to logarithms of random variables). These operations have some interpretations in terms of empirical spectral measures of random matrices.[1]

Free convolution is the free probability analog of the classical notion of convolution of probability measures. Due to the non-commutative nature of free probability theory, one has to talk separately about additive and multiplicative free convolution, which arise from addition and multiplication of free random variables (see below; in the classical case, what would be the analog of free multiplicative convolution can be reduced to additive convolution by passing to logarithms of random variables). These operations have some interpretations in terms of empirical spectral measures of random matrices.[1]
The notion of free convolution was introduced by Voiculescu.[2][3]

Explicit computations of multiplicative free convolution can be carried out using complex-analytic techniques and the S-transform.
Through its applications to random matrices, free convolution has some strong connections with other works on G-estimation of Girko.
The applications in wireless communications, finance and biology have provided a useful framework when the number of observations is of the same order as the dimensions of the system.
