ABOUT
In coding theory, the Wozencraft ensemble is a set of linear codes in which most of codes satisfy the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. It is named after John Wozencraft, who proved its existence. The ensemble is described by Massey (1963), who attributes it to Wozencraft. Justesen (1972) used the Wozencraft ensemble as the inner codes in his construction of strongly explicit asymptotically good code.

In coding theory, the Wozencraft ensemble is a set of linear codes in which most of codes satisfy the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. It is named after John Wozencraft, who proved its existence. The ensemble is described by Massey (1963), who attributes it to Wozencraft. Justesen (1972) used the Wozencraft ensemble as the inner codes in his construction of strongly explicit asymptotically good code.


Here relative distance is the ratio of minimum distance to block length. And 




H

q




{\displaystyle H_{q}}

 is the q-ary entropy function defined as follows:
In fact, to show the existence of this set of linear codes, we will specify this ensemble explicitly as follows: for 



α
∈


F



q

k




−
{
0
}


{\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {F} _{q^{k}}-\{0\}}

, define the inner code
Here we can notice that 



x
∈


F


q


k




{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {F} _{q}^{k}}

 and 



α
∈


F



q

k






{\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {F} _{q^{k}}}

. We can do the multiplication 



α

{\displaystyle \alpha x}

 since 





F


q


k




{\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{q}^{k}}

 is isomorphic to 





F



q

k






{\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{q^{k}}}

.
This ensemble is due to Wozencraft and is called the Wozencraft ensemble.
For all 



x
,
y
∈


F


q


k




{\displaystyle x,y\in \mathbb {F} _{q}^{k}}

, we have the following facts:
So 




C

{\displaystyle C_{in}^{\alpha }}

 is a linear code for every 



α

{\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {F} _{q^{k}}-\{0\}}

.
Now we know that Wozencraft ensemble contains linear codes with rate

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}}

. In the following proof, we will show that there are at least 



(

{\displaystyle (1-\varepsilon )N}

 those linear codes having the relative distance 



⩾

{\displaystyle \geqslant H_{q}^{-1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}-\varepsilon \right)}

, i.e. they meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
To prove that there are at least

{\displaystyle \geqslant H_{q}^{-1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}-\varepsilon \right)}

{\displaystyle <H_{q}^{-1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}-\varepsilon \right)\cdot 2k.}


Notice that in a linear code, the distance is equal to the minimum weight of all codewords of that code. This fact is the property of linear code. So if one non-zero codeword has weight 



<

(

⋅

k


{\displaystyle <H_{q}^{-1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}-\varepsilon \right)\cdot 2k}

, then that code has distance 



<

{\displaystyle <H_{q}^{-1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}-\varepsilon \right)\cdot 2k.}


Let

{\displaystyle <H_{q}^{-1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}-\varepsilon \right)\cdot 2k.}

 Then there are

{\displaystyle |P|}

 linear codes having some codeword that has weight

{\displaystyle <H_{q}^{-1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}-\varepsilon \right)\cdot 2k.}


Any linear code having distance

{\displaystyle <H_{q}^{-1}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}-\varepsilon \right)\cdot 2k}

 Now the Lemma implies that we have at least
