 of the cake. This is in contrast to proportional division procedures, which give each partner at least

 of the cake, but may give more to some of the partners.
When 



n
=
2


{\displaystyle n=2}

, the division generated by Austin's procedure is an exact division and it is also envy-free. Moreover, it is possible to divide the cake to any number k of pieces which both partners value as exactly 1/k. Hence, it is possible to divide the cake between the partners in any fraction (e.g. give 1/3 to Alice and 2/3 to George).
When 



n
>
2


{\displaystyle n>2}

, the division is neither exact nor envy-free, since each partner only values his own piece as

{\displaystyle 1/n}

, but may value other pieces differently.
The main mathematical tool used by Austin's procedure is the intermediate value theorem (IVT).[1][2][3]:66


The basic procedures involve 



n
=

{\displaystyle n=2}

 partners who want to divide a cake such that each of them gets exactly one half.
For the sake of description, call the two players Alice and George, and assume the cake is rectangular.
A single knife can be used to achieve the same effect.
Alice must of course end the turn with the knife on the same line as where it started. Again, by the IVT, there must be a point in which George feels that the two halves are equal.
As noted by Austin, the two partners can find a single piece of cake that both of them value as exactly

Two partners can achieve an exact division with any rational ratio of entitlements by a slightly more complicated procedure.[3]:71
