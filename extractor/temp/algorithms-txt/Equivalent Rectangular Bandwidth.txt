The equivalent rectangular bandwidth or ERB is a measure used in psychoacoustics, which gives an approximation to the bandwidths of the filters in human hearing, using the unrealistic but convenient simplification of modeling the filters as rectangular band-pass filters.


For moderate sound levels and young listeners, the bandwidth of human auditory filters can be approximated by the polynomial equation:

{\displaystyle \mathrm {ERB} (f)=6.23\cdot f^{2}+93.39\cdot f+28.52}

 [1]

 
 
 
 
(Eq.1)
where f is the center frequency of the filter in kHz and ERB(f) is the bandwidth of the filter in Hz. The approximation is based on the results of a number of published simultaneous masking experiments and is valid from 0.1 to 6.5 kHz.[1]
The above approximation was given in 1983 by Moore and Glasberg,[1] who in 1990 published another (linear) approximation:[2]

{\displaystyle \mathrm {ERB} (f)=24.7\cdot (4.37\cdot f+1)}

 [2]

 
 
 
 
(Eq.2)
where f is in kHz and ERB(f) is in Hz. The approximation is applicable at moderate sound levels and for values of f between 0.1 and 10 kHz.[2]
The ERB-rate scale, or simply ERB scale, can be defined as a function ERBS(f) which returns the number of equivalent rectangular bandwidths below the given frequency f. It can be constructed by solving the following differential system of equations:
The solution for ERBS(f) is the integral of the reciprocal of ERB(f) with the constant of integration set in such a way that ERBS(0) = 0.[1]
Using the second order polynomial approximation (Eq.1) for ERB(f) yields:
where f is in kHz. The VOICEBOX speech processing toolbox for MATLAB implements the conversion and its inverse as:
where f is in Hz.
Using the linear approximation (Eq.2) for ERB(f) yields:
where f is in Hz.
