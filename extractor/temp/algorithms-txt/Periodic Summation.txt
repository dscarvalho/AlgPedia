When

  at intervals of 1/P.[1][2]  That identity is a form of the Poisson summation formula. Similarly, a Fourier series whose coefficients are samples of  



s
(
t
)


{\displaystyle s(t)}

  at constant intervals (T) is equivalent to a periodic summation of  



S

,


{\displaystyle S(f),}

  which is known as a discrete-time Fourier transform.
The periodic summation of a Dirac delta function is the Dirac comb. Likewise, the periodic summation of an integrable function is its convolution with the Dirac comb.
If a periodic function is represented using the quotient space domain
