FULL TEXT
The top-nodes algorithm is an algorithm for managing a resource reservation calendar.[1]
It is used when a resource is shared among lots of users (for example bandwidth in a telecommunication link, or disk capacity in a large data center).
The algorithm allows


The calendar is stored as a binary tree where leaves represent elementary time periods. Other nodes represent the period of time covered by all their descendants.
The period of time covered by a reservation is represented by a set of "top-nodes". This set is the minimal set of nodes that exactly cover the reservation period of time.
A node of the binary tree is a "top-node" for a given reservation if
and
The following value is stored in each node:
(for code optimization, the two parts of this sum are usually stored separately.)
The advantage of this algorithm is that the time to register a new resource reservation depends only on the calendar size (it does not depend on the total number of reservations).
Let "n" be the number of elementary periods in the calendar.
The maximal number of "top-nodes" for a given reservation is 2.log n.
where M is the number of reservations that are active during the added calendar periods.
(M = 0 if reservations are not allowed after the end of the calendar.)
