 of multiplicative order 3 (since 43 = 64 ≡ 1 mod 7). For n = 3, a = (1, 2, 1) and x = 5 (the bit representation of 5 is 101), we can compute 




f

{\displaystyle f_{a}(5)}

 as follows:
The evaluation of function 




f

a


(
x
)


{\displaystyle f_{a}(x)}

 in the Naor-Reingold construction can be done very efficiently. Computing the value of the function 




f

a


(
x
)


{\displaystyle f_{a}(x)}

 at any given point is comparable with one modular exponentiation and n-modular multiplications. This function can be computed in parallel by threshold circuits of bounded depth and polynomial size.
The Naor-Reingold function can be used as the basis of many cryptographic schemes including symmetric encryption, authentication and digital signatures.
Assume that an attacker sees several outputs of the function, e.g.

 so that the computation corresponds to computing the Diffie-Hellman key between two of the earlier results. This attacker wants to predict the next sequence element. Such an attack would be very bad—but it's also possible to fight it off by working in groups with a hard Diffie-Hellman problem (DHP).
Example: An attacker sees several outputs of the function e.g. 




f

(

=

=

=
4


{\displaystyle f_{a}(1)=4^{1^{0}2^{0}1^{1}}=4^{1}=4}

. Then, the attacker wants to predict the next sequence element of this function, 




f

a


(
6
)


{\displaystyle f_{a}(6)}

. However, the attacker cannot predict the outcome of 




f

a


(
6
)


{\displaystyle f_{a}(6)}

 from knowing 




f

a


(
1
)


{\displaystyle f_{a}(1)}

 and 




f

a


(
5
)


{\displaystyle f_{a}(5)}

.

There are other attacks that would be very bad for a Pseudorandom Number Generator: the user expects to get random numbers from the output, so of course the stream should not be predictable, but even more, it should be indistinguishable from a random string. Let

One natural measure of how useful a sequence may be for cryptographic purposes is the size of its linear complexity. The linear complexity of an n-element sequence W(x), x = 0,1,2,…,n – 1, over a ring 





R




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}

 is the length l of the shortest linear recurrence relation W(x + l) = Al−1 W(x +l−1) + … + A0 W(x), x = 0,1,2,…, n – l –1 with A0, …, Al-1 ∈

Although this property does not seem to have any immediate cryptographic implications, the inverse fact, namely non uniform distribution, if true would have disastrous consequences for applications of this function.[4]
The elliptic curve version of this function is of interest as well. In particular, it may help to improve the cryptographic security of the corresponding system. Let p > 3 be prime and let E be an elliptic curve over
