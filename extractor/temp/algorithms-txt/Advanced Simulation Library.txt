ABOUT
Advanced Simulation Library (ASL) is free and open source hardware accelerated multiphysics simulation platform. It enables users to write customized numerical solvers in C++ and deploy them on a variety of massively parallel architectures, ranging from inexpensive FPGAs, DSPs and GPUs[1] up to heterogeneous clusters and supercomputers. Its internal computational engine is written in OpenCL and utilizes matrix-free solution techniques. ASL implements variety of advanced numerical methods,[2] i.a. Level set method, Lattice Boltzmann, Immersed Boundary. Mesh-free, immersed boundary approach allows to move from CAD directly to simulation significantly reducing pre-processing efforts and amount of potential errors. ASL can be used to model various coupled physical and chemical phenomena, especially in the field of Computational fluid dynamics. It is distributed under the free GNU Affero General Public License with an optional commercial license.

Advanced Simulation Library is being developed by Avtech Scientific, an Israeli company. Its source code was released to the community on 14 May 2015 whose members packaged it for scientific sections of all major Linux distributions shortly thereafter.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Subsequently Khronos Group acknowledged the significance of ASL and listed it on its website among OpenCL-based resources.[9]
ASL provides a range of features to solve number of problems - from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid mechanics and elasticity.[13]
