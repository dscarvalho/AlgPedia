ABOUT
In the theories of modulation and of stochastic processes, random modulation is the creation of a new signal from two other signals by the process of quadrature amplitude modulation. In particular, the two signals are considered as being random processes. For applications, the two original signals need have a limited frequency range, and these are used to modulate a third sinusoidal carrier signal whose frequency is above the range of frequencies contained in the original signals.

In the theories of modulation and of stochastic processes, random modulation is the creation of a new signal from two other signals by the process of quadrature amplitude modulation. In particular, the two signals are considered as being random processes. For applications, the two original signals need have a limited frequency range, and these are used to modulate a third sinusoidal carrier signal whose frequency is above the range of frequencies contained in the original signals.
The random modulation procedure starts with two stochastic baseband signals,

{\displaystyle x_{c}(t)}

 and 




x

{\displaystyle x_{s}(t)}

, whose frequency spectrum is non-zero only for
