 autocorrelation matrix, the dimension of the noise subspace is equal to one and is spanned by the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue. This eigenvector is orthogonal to each of the signal vectors.
The frequency estimates may be determined by setting the frequencies equal to the angles of the roots of the eigenfilter
or the location of the peaks in the frequency estimation function
where

 is the noise eigenvector and
Vladilen Fedorovich Pisarenko originated this method in 1973 while examining the problem of estimating the frequencies of complex signals in white noise. He found that the frequencies could be derived from the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix.[2]
