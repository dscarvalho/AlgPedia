Subtract-with-carry is a pseudorandom number generator of the lagged Fibonacci type introduced by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman in 1991.[1] It is one of three random number generator engines included in the standard C++11 library.[2]
Sequence generated by the subtract-with-carry engine may be described by the recurrence relation:




x
(
i
)
=
(
x
(
i
−
S
)
−
x
(
i
−
R
)
−
c
y
(
i
−
1
)
)
 

mod

 


M


{\displaystyle x(i)=(x(i-S)-x(i-R)-cy(i-1))\ {\bmod {\ }}M}


where 



c
y
(
i
)
=


{



1
,



if 

x
(
i
−
S
)
−
x
(
i
−
R
)
−
c
y
(
i
−

)
<
0




0
,



otherwise









{\displaystyle cy(i)={\begin{cases}1,&{\text{if }}x(i-S)-x(i-R)-cy(i-1)<0\\0,&{\text{otherwise}}\end{cases}}}

.
Constants S and R are known as the short and long lags, respectively.[3] Therefore, expressions 



x
(
i
−
S
)


{\displaystyle x(i-S)}

 and 



x
(
i
−
R
)


{\displaystyle x(i-R)}

 correspond to the S-th and R-th previous terms of the sequence. S and R satisfy the condition 



0
<
S
<
R


{\displaystyle 0<S<R}

. Modulus M has the value 



M
=

2

W




{\displaystyle M=2^{W}}

, where W is the word size, in bits, of the state sequence and 



W
>
0


{\displaystyle W>0}

.
The subtract-with-carry engine is one of the family of generators which includes as well add-with-carry and subtract-with-borrow engines.[1]
