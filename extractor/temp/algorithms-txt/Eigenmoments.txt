FULL TEXT
EigenMoments[1] is a set of orthogonal, noise robust, invariant to rotation, scaling and translation and distribution sensitive moments. Their application can be found in signal processing and computer vision as descriptors of the signal or image. The descriptors can later be used for classification purposes.
It is obtained by performing orthogonalization, via eigen analysis on geometric moments.[2]


EigenMoments are computed by performing eigen analysis on the moment space of an image by maximizing Signal to Noise Ratio in the feature space in form of Rayleigh quotient.
This approach has several benefits in Image processing applications:
Assume that a signal vector 



s
∈



R



n




{\displaystyle s\in {\mathcal {R}}^{n}}

 is taken from a certain distribution having coorelation 



C
∈



R



n
×
n




{\displaystyle C\in {\mathcal {R}}^{n\times n}}

,i.e. 



C
=
E
[
s

s

T


]


{\displaystyle C=E[ss^{T}]}

 where E[.] denotes expected value.
Dimension of signal space, n, is often too large to be useful for practical application such as pattern classification, we need to transform the signal space into a space with lower dimensionality.
This is performed by a two-step linear transformation:




q
=

W

T



X

T


s
,


{\displaystyle q=W^{T}X^{T}s,}


where 



q
=

T


∈

k




{\displaystyle q=[q_{1},...,q_{n}]^{T}\in {\mathcal {R}}^{k}}

 is the transformed signal,

]

T


∈

n
×
m




{\displaystyle X=[x_{1},...,x_{n}]^{T}\in {\mathcal {R}}^{n\times m}}

 a fixed transformation matrix which transforms the signal into the moment space, and 



W

]

T


∈

k




{\displaystyle W=[w_{1},...,w_{n}]^{T}\in {\mathcal {R}}^{m\times k}}

 the transformation matrix which we are going to determine by maximizing the SNR of the feature space resided by 



q


{\displaystyle q}

. For the case of Geometric Moments, X would be the monomials. If 



m
=
k
=
n


{\displaystyle m=k=n}

, a full rank transformation would result, however usually we have 



m
≤
n


{\displaystyle m\leq n}

 and 



k
≤
m


{\displaystyle k\leq m}

. This is specially the case when 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is of high dimensions.
Finding 



W


{\displaystyle W}

 that maximizes the SNR of the feature space:

{\displaystyle SNR_{transform}={\frac {w^{T}X^{T}CXw}{w^{T}X^{T}NXw}},}


where N is the correlation matrix of the noise signal. The problem can thus be formulated as

,


{\displaystyle w_{i}^{T}X^{T}NXw_{j}=\delta _{ij},}

 where 




δ

j




{\displaystyle \delta _{ij}}

 is the Kronecker delta.
It can be observed that this maximization is Rayleigh quotient by letting 



A
=

X

T


C
X


{\displaystyle A=X^{T}CX}

 and 



B
=

X

T


N
X


{\displaystyle B=X^{T}NX}

 and therefore can be written as:

{\displaystyle w_{i}^{T}Bw_{j}=\delta _{ij}}


Optimization of Rayleigh quotient[3][4] has the form:





max

R
(
w
)
=

max

w






w

T


A
w



w

T


B
w





{\displaystyle \max _{w}R(w)=\max _{w}{\frac {w^{T}Aw}{w^{T}Bw}}}


and 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 and 



B


{\displaystyle B}

, both are symmetric and 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is positive definite and therefore invertible. Scaling 



w


{\displaystyle w}

 does not change the value of the object function and hence and additional scalar constraint 




w

T


B
w
=
1


{\displaystyle w^{T}Bw=1}

 can be imposed on 



w


{\displaystyle w}

 and no solution would be lost when the objective function is optimized.
This constraint optimization problem can be solved using Lagrangian multiplier:





max

w




w

T


A
w



{\displaystyle \max _{w}{w^{T}Aw}}

 subject to 





w

T


B
w

=

{\displaystyle {w^{T}Bw}=1}

T

A
w
−
λ

w

T


B
w
)


{\displaystyle \max _{w}{\mathcal {L}}(w)=\max _{w}(w{T}Aw-\lambda w^{T}Bw)}


equating first derivative to zero and we will have:




A
w
=
λ
B
w


{\displaystyle Aw=\lambda Bw}


which is an instance of Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP). The GEP has the form:




A
w
=
λ
B
w


{\displaystyle Aw=\lambda Bw}


for any pair 



(
w
,
λ
)


{\displaystyle (w,\lambda )}

 that is a solution to above equation, 



w


{\displaystyle w}

 is called a generalized eigenvector and 



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }

 is called a generalized eigenvalue.
Finding 



w


{\displaystyle w}

 and 



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }

 that satisfies this equations would produce the result which optimizes Rayleigh quotient.
One way of maximizing Rayleigh quotient is through solving the Generalized Eigen Problem. Dimension reduction can be performed by simply choosing the first components 




w

i




{\displaystyle w_{i}}

, 



i
=
1
,
.
.
.
,
k


{\displaystyle i=1,...,k}

, with the highest values for 



R
(
w
)


{\displaystyle R(w)}

 out of the 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 components, and discard the rest. Interpretation of this transformation is rotating and scaling the moment space, transforming it into a feature space with maximized SNR and therefore, the first 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 components are the components with highest 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 SNR values.
The other method to look at this solution is to use the concept of simultaneous diagonalization instead of Generalized Eigen Problem.

D

{\displaystyle D_{B}>0}

. We can discard those eigenvalues that large and retain those close to 0, since this means the energy of the noise is close to 0 in this space, at this stage it is also possible to discard those eigenvectors that have large eigenvalues.

Eigenmoments are derived by applying the above framework on Geometric Moments. They can be derived for both 1D and 2D signals.
If we let 



X
=
[
1
,
x
,

x

2


,
.
.
.
,

x

m
−
1


]


{\displaystyle X=[1,x,x^{2},...,x^{m-1}]}

, i.e. the monomials, after the transformation 




X

T




{\displaystyle X^{T}}

 we obtain Geometric Moments, denoted by vector 



M


{\displaystyle M}

, of signal 



s
=
[
s
(
x
)
]


{\displaystyle s=[s(x)]}

,i.e. 



M
=

X

T


s


{\displaystyle M=X^{T}s}

.
In practice it is difficult to estimate the correlation signal due to insufficient number of samples, therefore parametric approaches are utilized.
One such model can be defined as:




r
(

x

1


,

x

2


)
=
r
(
0
,
0
)

e

−
c
(

)

{\displaystyle r(x_{1},x_{2})=r(0,0)e^{-c(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}}}

,
where 



r
(
0
,
0
)
=
E
[
t
r
(
s

s

T


)
]


{\displaystyle r(0,0)=E[tr(ss^{T})]}

. This model of correlation can be replaced by other models however this model covers general natural images.
Since 



r
(
0
,
0
)


{\displaystyle r(0,0)}

 does not affect the maximization it can be dropped.
