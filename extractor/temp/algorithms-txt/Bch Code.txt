In coding theory, the BCH codes form a class of cyclic error-correcting codes that are constructed using finite fields. BCH codes were invented in 1959 by French mathematician Alexis Hocquenghem, and independently in 1960 by Raj Bose and D. K.

In coding theory, the BCH codes form a class of cyclic error-correcting codes that are constructed using finite fields. BCH codes were invented in 1959 by French mathematician Alexis Hocquenghem, and independently in 1960 by Raj Bose and D. K. Ray-Chaudhuri.[1][2][3] The acronym BCH comprises the initials of these inventors' surnames (mistakingly, in the case of Ray-Chaudhuri).
One of the key features of BCH codes is that during code design, there is a precise control over the number of symbol errors correctable by the code. In particular, it is possible to design binary BCH codes that can correct multiple bit errors. Another advantage of BCH codes is the ease with which they can be decoded, namely, via an algebraic method known as syndrome decoding. This simplifies the design of the decoder for these codes, using small low-power electronic hardware.
BCH codes are used in applications such as satellite communications,[4] compact disc players, DVDs, disk drives, solid-state drives[5] and two-dimensional bar codes.


Given a prime power q and positive integers m and d with d ≤ qm − 1, a primitive narrow-sense BCH code over the finite field GF(q) with code length n = qm − 1 and distance at least d is constructed by the following method.
Let α be a primitive element of GF(qm). For any positive integer i, let mi(x) be the minimal polynomial of αi over GF(q). The generator polynomial of the BCH code is defined as the least common multiple g(x) = lcm(m1(x),…,md − 1(x)). It can be seen that g(x) is a polynomial with coefficients in GF(q) and divides xn − 1. Therefore, the polynomial code defined by g(x) is a cyclic code.
Let q=2 and m=4 (therefore n=15). We will consider different values of d. There is a primitive root α in GF(16) satisfying

This code has minimal Hamming distance 15 and corrects 7 errors. It has 1 data bit and 14 checksum bits. In fact, this code has only two codewords: 000000000000000 and 111111111111111.
General BCH codes differ from primitive narrow-sense BCH codes in two respects.
First, the requirement that 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 be a primitive element of 




G
F

(

q

m


)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {GF} (q^{m})}

 can be relaxed. By relaxing this requirement, the code length changes from 




q

m


−
1


{\displaystyle q^{m}-1}

 to 




o
r
d

(
α
)
,


{\displaystyle \mathrm {ord} (\alpha ),}

 the order of the element 



α
.


{\displaystyle \alpha .}


Second, the consecutive roots of the generator polynomial may run from

{\displaystyle \alpha ,\ldots ,\alpha ^{d-1}.}


Definition. Fix a finite field 



G
F
(
q
)
,


{\displaystyle GF(q),}

 where 



q


{\displaystyle q}

 is a prime power. Choose positive integers 



m
,
n
,
d
,
c


{\displaystyle m,n,d,c}

 such that 



2
≤
d

{\displaystyle 2\leq d\leq n,}

 





g
c
d


(
n
,
q
)
=
1
,


{\displaystyle {\rm {gcd}}(n,q)=1,}

 and 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 is the multiplicative order of 



q


{\displaystyle q}

 modulo 



n
.


{\displaystyle n.}


As before, let 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 be a primitive 



n


{\displaystyle n}

th root of unity in 



G
F
(

q

m


)
,


{\displaystyle GF(q^{m}),}

 and let 




m

(
x
)


{\displaystyle m_{i}(x)}

 be the minimal polynomial over 



G
F
(

)


{\displaystyle GF(q)}

 of 




α

{\displaystyle \alpha ^{i}}

 for all

 The generator polynomial of the BCH code is defined as the least common multiple 



g
(

)
=

)
.


{\displaystyle g(x)={\rm {lcm}}(m_{c}(x),\ldots ,m_{c+d-2}(x)).}


Note: if 



n
=

q

m


−
1


{\displaystyle n=q^{m}-1}

 as in the simplified definition, then 





g
c
d


(
n
,
q
)


{\displaystyle {\rm {gcd}}(n,q)}

 is 1, and the order of 



q


{\displaystyle q}

 modulo 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is 



m
.


{\displaystyle m.}

 Therefore, the simplified definition is indeed a special case of the general one.
The generator polynomial 



g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle g(x)}

 of a BCH code has coefficients from 




G
F

(
q
)
.


{\displaystyle \mathrm {GF} (q).}

 In general, a cyclic code over 




G
F

(

q

p


)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {GF} (q^{p})}

 with 



g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle g(x)}

 as the generator polynomial is called a BCH code over 




G
F

(

q

)
.


{\displaystyle \mathrm {GF} (q^{p}).}

 The BCH code over 




G
F

(

q

m


)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {GF} (q^{m})}

 with 



g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle g(x)}

 as the generator polynomial is called a Reed–Solomon code. In other words, a Reed–Solomon code is a BCH code where the decoder alphabet is the same as the channel alphabet.[6]
The generator polynomial of a BCH code has degree at most 



(
d
−
1
)
m


{\displaystyle (d-1)m}

. Moreover, if 



q
=
2


{\displaystyle q=2}

 and 



c
=
1


{\displaystyle c=1}

, the generator polynomial has degree at most 



d
m

/

2


{\displaystyle dm/2}

.
Each minimal polynomial 




m

i


(
x
)


{\displaystyle m_{i}(x)}

 has degree at most 



m


{\displaystyle m}

. Therefore, the least common multiple of 



d
−
1


{\displaystyle d-1}

 of them has degree at most 



(
d
−
1
)
m


{\displaystyle (d-1)m}

. Moreover, if 



q

{\displaystyle q=2,}

 then 




m

(
x
)
=

m

2
i


(
x
)


{\displaystyle m_{i}(x)=m_{2i}(x)}

 for all 



i


{\displaystyle i}

. Therefore, 



g
(

)


{\displaystyle g(x)}

 is the least common multiple of at most 



d

{\displaystyle d/2}

 minimal polynomials 




m

(

)


{\displaystyle m_{i}(x)}

 for odd indices 



i

 each of degree at most 



m


{\displaystyle m}

.
A BCH code has minimal Hamming distance at least 



d


{\displaystyle d}

.
Suppose that 



p
(
x
)


{\displaystyle p(x)}

 is a code word with fewer than 



d


{\displaystyle d}

 non-zero terms. Then
Recall that 




α

c


,

,

α

c
+
d
−

{\displaystyle \alpha ^{c},\ldots ,\alpha ^{c+d-2}}

 are roots of 



g
(
x
)
,


{\displaystyle g(x),}

 hence of 



p
(
x
)


{\displaystyle p(x)}

. This implies that 




b

1


,
…
,

b

d
−
1




{\displaystyle b_{1},\ldots ,b_{d-1}}

 satisfy the following equations, for each 



i
∈
{
c
,
…
,
c
+
d
−
2
}


{\displaystyle i\in \{c,\dotsc ,c+d-2\}}

:
In matrix form, we have
The determinant of this matrix equals
The matrix 



V


{\displaystyle V}

 is seen to be a Vandermonde matrix, and its determinant is
which is non-zero. It therefore follows that 




b

1


,
…
,

b

d
−

=
0
,


{\displaystyle b_{1},\ldots ,b_{d-1}=0,}

 hence 



p

=
0.


{\displaystyle p(x)=0.}


A BCH code is cyclic.
A polynomial code of length 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is cyclic if and only if its generator polynomial divides 




x

n


−
1.


{\displaystyle x^{n}-1.}

 Since 



g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle g(x)}

 is the minimal polynomial with roots 




α

c


,
…
,

α

c
+
d
−
2


,


{\displaystyle \alpha ^{c},\ldots ,\alpha ^{c+d-2},}

 it suffices to check that each of 




α

c


,
…
,

α

c
+
d
−
2




{\displaystyle \alpha ^{c},\ldots ,\alpha ^{c+d-2}}

 is a root of 




x

n


−
1.


{\displaystyle x^{n}-1.}

 This follows immediately from the fact that 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 is, by definition, an 



n


{\displaystyle n}

th root of unity.
There are many algorithms for decoding BCH codes. The most common ones follow this general outline:
During some of these steps, the decoding algorithm may determine that the received vector has too many errors and cannot be corrected. For example, if an appropriate value of t is not found, then the correction would fail. In a truncated (not primitive) code, an error location may be out of range. If the received vector has more errors than the code can correct, the decoder may unknowingly produce an apparently valid message that is not the one that was sent.
The received vector 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is the sum of the correct codeword 



C


{\displaystyle C}

 and an unknown error vector 



E
.


{\displaystyle E.}

 The syndrome values are formed by considering 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 as a polynomial and evaluating it at 




α

c


,
…
,

α

c
+
d
−
2


.


{\displaystyle \alpha ^{c},\ldots ,\alpha ^{c+d-2}.}

 Thus the syndromes are[7]
for 



j
=
c


{\displaystyle j=c}

 to 



c
+
d
−
2.


{\displaystyle c+d-2.}

 Since 




α

j




{\displaystyle \alpha ^{j}}

 are the zeros of 



g
(
x
)
,


{\displaystyle g(x),}

 of which 



C
(
x
)


{\displaystyle C(x)}

 is a multiple, 



C
(

α

j


)
=
0.


{\displaystyle C(\alpha ^{j})=0.}

 Examining the syndrome values thus isolates the error vector so one can begin to solve for it.
If there is no error, 




s

j


=
0


{\displaystyle s_{j}=0}

 for all 



j
.


{\displaystyle j.}

 If the syndromes are all zero, then the decoding is done.
If there are nonzero syndromes, then there are errors. The decoder needs to figure out how many errors and the location of those errors.
If there is a single error, write this as 



E
(
x
)
=
e


x

i


,


{\displaystyle E(x)=e\,x^{i},}

 where 



i


{\displaystyle i}

 is the location of the error and 



e


{\displaystyle e}

 is its magnitude. Then the first two syndromes are
so together they allow us to calculate 



e


{\displaystyle e}

 and provide some information about 



i


{\displaystyle i}

 (completely determining it in the case of Reed–Solomon codes).
If there are two or more errors,
It is not immediately obvious how to begin solving the resulting syndromes for the unknowns 




e

k




{\displaystyle e_{k}}

 and 




i

k


.


{\displaystyle i_{k}.}

 First step is finding locator polynomial
Two popular algorithms for this task are:

Now the procedure of the Peterson–Gorenstein–Zierler algorithm.[8] Expect we have at least 2t syndromes sc,...,sc+2t−1. Let v = t.
Now that you have the 



Λ
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \Lambda (x)}

 polynomial, its roots can be found in the form 



Λ

−

)


{\displaystyle \Lambda (x)=(\alpha ^{i_{1}}x-1)(\alpha ^{i_{2}}x-1)\cdots (\alpha ^{i_{v}}x-1)}

 by brute force for example using the Chien search algorithm. The exponential powers of the primitive element 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 will yield the positions where errors occur in the received word; hence the name 'error locator' polynomial.
The zeros of Λ(x) are α−i1, ..., α−iv.
Once the error locations are known, the next step is to determine the error values at those locations. The error values are then used to correct the received values at those locations to recover the original codeword.
For the case of binary BCH, (with all characters readable) this is trivial; just flip the bits for the received word at these positions, and we have the corrected code word. In the more general case, the error weights 




e

j




{\displaystyle e_{j}}

 can be determined by solving the linear system
However, there is a more efficient method known as the Forney algorithm.
Let
And the error evaluator polynomial[9]
Finally:
where
Than if syndromes could be explained by an error word, which could be nonzero only on positions

For narrow-sense BCH codes, c = 1, so the expression simplifies to:
It is based on Lagrange interpolation and techniques of generating functions.
Consider

{\displaystyle k>c+d-2.}

 Then
We want to compute unknowns 




e

{\displaystyle e_{j},}

 and we could simplify the context by removing the

{\displaystyle (x\alpha ^{i_{j}})^{d-1}}

Thanks to

{\displaystyle v\leqslant d-1}

 we have
Thanks to

we get again only one summand in
So finally
This formula is advantageous when one computes the formal derivative of

yielding:

An alternate process of finding both the polynomial Λ and the error locator polynomial is based on Yasuo Sugiyama's adaptation of the Extended Euclidean algorithm.[10] Correction of unreadable characters could be incorporated to the algorithm easily as well.

 errors (on readable positions), because with bigger error count there could be more codewords in the same distance from the received word. Therefore, for 



Λ
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \Lambda (x)}

 we are looking for, the equation must hold for coefficients near powers starting from
In Forney formula, 



Λ
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \Lambda (x)}

 could be multiplied by a scalar giving the same result.
It could happen that the Euclidean algorithm finds 



Λ

{\displaystyle \Lambda (x)}

 of degree higher than

(
d

−
k
)


{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}(d-1-k)}

 having number of different roots equal to its degree, where the Fourney formula would be able to correct errors in all its roots, anyways correcting such many errors could be risky (especially with no other restrictions on received word). Usually after getting 



Λ
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \Lambda (x)}

 of higher degree, we decide not to correct the errors. Correction could fail in the case 



Λ
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \Lambda (x)}

 has roots with higher multiplicity or the number of roots is smaller than its degree. Fail could be detected as well by Forney formula returning error outside the transmitted alphabet.
Using the error values and error location, correct the errors and form a corrected code vector by subtracting error values at error locations.

 The "checksum" symbols are calculated by dividing

M

{\displaystyle x^{10}M(x)}

 by

{\displaystyle g(x)}

 and taking the remainder, resulting in

{\displaystyle x^{9}+x^{4}+x^{2}}

 or [ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]. These are appended to the message, so the transmitted codeword is [ 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ].
Now, imagine that there are two bit-errors in the transmission, so the received codeword is [ 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 ]. In polynomial notation:
In order to correct the errors, first calculate the syndromes. Taking 



α
=
0010
,


{\displaystyle \alpha =0010,}

 we have 




s

=
R
(

α

)
=

,


{\displaystyle s_{1}=R(\alpha ^{1})=1011,}

{\displaystyle s_{2}=1001,}

=

,


{\displaystyle s_{5}=0001,}

 and 




s

6


=
1001.


{\displaystyle s_{6}=1001.}

 Next, apply the Peterson procedure by row-reducing the following augmented matrix.
Due to the zero row, S3×3 is singular, which is no surprise since only two errors were introduced into the codeword. However, the upper-left corner of the matrix is identical to [S2×2 | C2×1], which gives rise to the solution

,


{\displaystyle \lambda _{2}=1000,}

 




λ

{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}=1011.}

 The resulting error locator polynomial is

{\displaystyle 0100=\alpha ^{-13}}

 and

{\displaystyle 0111=\alpha ^{-5}.}

 The exponents of 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 correspond to the error locations. There is no need to calculate the error values in this example, as the only possible value is 1.
Suppose the same scenario, but the received word has two unreadable characters [ 1 0 0 ? 1 1 ? 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 ]. We replace the unreadable characters by zeros while creating the polynom reflecting their positions

 (Using log notation which is independent on GF(24) isomorphisms. For computation checking we can use the same representation for addition as was used in previous example. Hexadecimal description of the powers of

 are consecutively 1,2,4,8,3,6,C,B,5,A,7,E,F,D,9 with the addition based on bitwise xor.)

Let us show the algorithm behaviour for the case with small number of errors. Let the received word is [ 1 0 0 ? 1 1 ? 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ].
