The Remez algorithm or Remez exchange algorithm, published by Evgeny Yakovlevich Remez in 1934,[1] is an iterative algorithm used to find simple approximations to functions, specifically, approximations by functions in a Chebyshev space that are the best in the uniform norm L∞ sense.
A typical example of a Chebyshev space is the subspace of Chebyshev polynomials of order n in the space of real continuous functions on an interval, C[a, b]. The polynomial of best approximation within a given subspace is defined to be the one that minimizes the maximum absolute difference between the polynomial and the function. In this case, the form of the solution is precised by the equioscillation theorem.


The Remez algorithm starts with the function f to be approximated and a set X of

 in the approximation interval, usually the Chebyshev nodes linearly mapped to the interval. The steps are:
The result is called the polynomial of best approximation or the minimax approximation.
A review of technicalities in implementing the Remez algorithm is given by W. Fraser.[2]
The Chebyshev nodes are a common choice for the initial approximation because of their role in the theory of polynomial interpolation. For the initialization of the optimization problem for function f by the Lagrange interpolant Ln(f), it can be shown that this initial approximation is bounded by
with the norm or Lebesgue constant of the Lagrange interpolation operator Ln of the nodes (t1, ..., tn + 1) being
T being the zeros of the Chebyshev polynomials, and the Lebesgue functions being
Theodore A. Kilgore,[3] Carl de Boor, and Allan Pinkus[4] proved that there exists a unique ti for each Ln, although not known explicitly for (ordinary) polynomials. Similarly,

The error at the given n+2 ordered nodes is positive and negative in turn because
The theorem of de La Vallée Poussin states that under this condition no polynomial of degree n exists with error less than E. Indeed, if such a polynomial existed, call it

 and therefore have at least n+1 zeros which is impossible for a polynomial of degree n. Thus, this E is a lower bound for the minimum error which can be achieved with polynomials of degree n.

 with 



min

{\displaystyle \min\{|z_{i}|\}\geq E}

 as the new lower bound for the best error possible with polynomials of degree n.
Moreover, 



max
{

z

i



|

}


{\displaystyle \max\{|z_{i}|\}}

 comes in handy as an obvious upper bound for that best possible error.
Step 4: With 



min

z

}


{\displaystyle \min \,\{|z_{i}|\}}

 and 



max

{

|


z

i



|

}


{\displaystyle \max \,\{|z_{i}|\}}

 as lower and upper bound for the best possible approximation error, one has a reliable stopping criterion: repeat the steps until 



max

z

}
−
min
{

z

}


{\displaystyle \max\{|z_{i}|\}-\min\{|z_{i}|\}}

 is sufficiently small or no longer decreases. These bounds indicate the progress.
Sometimes more than one sample point is replaced at the same time with the locations of nearby maximum absolute differences.
Sometimes relative error is used to measure the difference between the approximation and the function, especially if the approximation will be used to compute the function on a computer which uses floating point arithmetic.
