In quantum computing, the quantum Fourier transform is a linear transformation on quantum bits, and is the quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform. The quantum Fourier transform is a part of many quantum algorithms, notably Shor's algorithm for factoring and computing the discrete logarithm, the quantum phase estimation algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator, and algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem.
The quantum Fourier transform can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer, with a particular decomposition into a product of simpler unitary matrices. Using a simple decomposition, the discrete Fourier transform on

 amplitudes can be implemented as a quantum circuit consisting of only

{\displaystyle O(n^{2})}

 Hadamard gates and controlled phase shift gates, where 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is the number of qubits.[1] This can be compared with the classical discrete Fourier transform, which takes

 gates (where 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is the number of bits), which is exponentially more than

{\displaystyle O(n^{2})}

. However, the quantum Fourier transform acts on a quantum state, whereas the classical Fourier transform acts on a vector, so not every task that uses the classical Fourier transform can take advantage of this exponential speedup.
The best quantum Fourier transform algorithms known today require only

The quantum Fourier transform is the classical discrete Fourier transform applied to the vector of amplitudes of a quantum state. The classical (unitary) Fourier transform acts on a vector (x0, ..., xN−1) in 





C


N




{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{N}}

 and maps it to the vector (y0, ..., yN−1) according to the formula
where

{\displaystyle \omega ^{jk}=e^{2\pi i{\frac {j\,k}{N}}}}

 is a Nth root of unity.
Similarly, the quantum Fourier transform acts on a quantum state

 according to the formula:

This can also be expressed as the map
Equivalently, the quantum Fourier transform can be viewed as a unitary matrix (quantum gate, similar to a logic gate for classical computers) acting on quantum state vectors, where the unitary matrix

Most of the properties of the quantum Fourier transform follow from the fact that it is a unitary transformation. This can be checked by performing matrix multiplication and ensuring that the relation

F

I


{\displaystyle FF^{\dagger }=F^{\dagger }F=I}

 holds, where 




F

†




{\displaystyle F^{\dagger }}

 is the Hermitian adjoint of 



F


{\displaystyle F}

. Alternately, one can check that vectors of norm 1 get mapped to vectors of norm 1.
From the unitary property it follows that the inverse of the quantum Fourier transform is the Hermitian adjoint of the Fourier matrix, thus

. Since there is an efficient quantum circuit implementing the quantum Fourier transform, the circuit can be run in reverse to perform the inverse quantum Fourier transform. Thus both transforms can be efficiently performed on a quantum computer.
The quantum Fourier transform can be approximately implemented for any N; however, the implementation for the case where N is a power of 2 is much simpler. Suppose N = 2n. We have the orthonormal basis consisting of the vectors
The basis states enumerate all the possible states of the qubits:

{\displaystyle x_{j}}

 either 0 or 1. By convention, the basis state index 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 orders the possible states of the qubits lexicographically, i.e., by converting from binary to decimal in this way:
It is also useful to borrow fractional binary notation:
For instance,

{\displaystyle [0.x_{1}]={\frac {x_{1}}{2}}}

{\displaystyle [0.x_{1}x_{2}]={\frac {x_{1}}{2}}+{\frac {x_{2}}{2^{2}}}.}


With this notation, the action of the quantum Fourier transform can be expressed as:
where the output qubit 1 is in a superposition of state

In other words, the discrete Fourier transform, an operation on n-qubits, can be factored into the tensor product of n single-qubit operations, suggesting it is easily represented as a quantum circuit. In fact, each of those single-qubit operations can be implemented efficiently using a Hadamard gate and controlled phase gates. The first term requires one Hadamard gate, the next one requires a Hadamard gate and a controlled phase gate, and each following term requires an additional controlled phase gate. Summing up the number of gates gives
