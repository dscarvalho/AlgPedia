The Routh array is a tabular method permitting one to establish the stability of a system using only the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. Central to the field of control systems design, the Routh–Hurwitz theorem and Routh array emerge by using the Euclidean algorithm and Sturm's theorem in evaluating Cauchy indices.


Given the system:


Assuming no roots of

Now if the ith root of 



f

{\displaystyle f(x)=0\,}

and


Similarly, if the ith root of 



f

=

{\displaystyle f(x)=0\,}

 has a negative real part,

 when the ith root of

and


So, if we define


then we have the relationship


and combining (3) and (16) gives us


Therefore, given an equation of

In the case where the starting point is on an incongruity (i.e.

{\displaystyle \theta _{a}=\pi /2\pm i\pi \,}

N

{\displaystyle \theta '(x)\,}

To derive Routh's criterion, first we'll use a different notation to differentiate between the even and odd terms of 



f

{\displaystyle f(x)\,}

:


Now we have:


Therefore, if 



n



{\displaystyle n\,}

and if 



n



{\displaystyle n\,}

Now observe that if

{\displaystyle n\,}

{\displaystyle N+P\,}

 is odd. If 



N

P



{\displaystyle N+P\,}

N

P



{\displaystyle N-P\,}

 is odd as well. Similarly, this same argument shows that when 



n



{\displaystyle n\,}

 is even, 



N
−
P



{\displaystyle N-P\,}

 will be even. Equation (13) shows that if 



N
−
P



{\displaystyle N-P\,}

 is even, 



θ



{\displaystyle \theta \,}

 is an integer multiple of 



π



{\displaystyle \pi \,}

. Therefore, 



tan

(
θ

{\displaystyle \tan(\theta )\,}

 is defined for 



n



{\displaystyle n\,}

 even, and is thus the proper index to use when n is even, and similarly

cot

(

{\displaystyle \tan(\theta ')=\tan(\theta +\pi )=-\cot(\theta )\,}

 is defined for 



n



{\displaystyle n\,}

 odd, making it the proper index in this latter case.

Thus, from (6) and (22), for 



n



{\displaystyle n\,}

 even:


and from (18) and (23), for

 odd:

{\displaystyle x\,}

, then:


A sequence satisfying these requirements is obtained using the Euclidean algorithm, which is as follows:

Starting with 




f

(

{\displaystyle f_{1}(x)\,}

 and 




f

(

{\displaystyle f_{2}(x)\,}

, and denoting the remainder of

/

{\displaystyle f_{1}(x)/f_{2}(x)\,}

 by

 and similarly denoting the remainder of

{\displaystyle f_{2}(x)/f_{3}(x)\,}

 by

{\displaystyle f_{4}(x)\,}

, and so on, we obtain the relationships:


or in general


where the last non-zero remainder, 




f

{\displaystyle f_{m}(x)\,}

 will therefore be the highest common factor of

. It can be observed that the sequence so constructed will satisfy the conditions of Sturm's theorem, and thus an algorithm for determining the stated index has been developed.

It is in applying Sturm's theorem (28) to (26), through the use of the Euclidean algorithm above that the Routh matrix is formed.

We get

Continuing with the Euclidean algorithm on these new coefficients gives us

and giving us


The rows of the Routh array are determined exactly by this algorithm when applied to the coefficients of (19). An observation worthy of note is that in the regular case the polynomials 




f

(
ω
)



{\displaystyle f_{1}(\omega )\,}

 and 




f

(
ω
)



{\displaystyle f_{2}(\omega )\,}

 have as the highest common factor 




f

{\displaystyle f_{n+1}(\omega )\,}

In order for all the roots of the polynomial

 to have negative real parts, it is necessary and sufficient that all of the elements in the first column of the Routh scheme be different from zero and of the same sign.
