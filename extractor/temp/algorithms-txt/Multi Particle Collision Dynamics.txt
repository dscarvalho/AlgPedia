Multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC), also known as stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD),[1] is a particle-based mesoscale simulation technique for complex fluids which fully incorporates thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions.[2] Coupling of embedded particles to the coarse-grained solvent is achieved through molecular dynamics.[3]


The solvent is modelled as a set of

{\displaystyle N}

 point particles of mass

 with continuous coordinates

{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}_{i}}

 and velocities 







v

{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{i}}

. The simulation consists of streaming and collision steps.
During the streaming step, the coordinates of the particles are updated according to

 is a chosen simulation time step which is typically much larger than a molecular dynamics time step.
After the streaming step, interactions between the solvent particles are modelled in the collision step. The particles are sorted into collision cells with a lateral size

. Particle velocities within each cell are updated according to the collision rule

 is the centre of mass velocity of the particles in the collision cell and

 around a random rotation axis. The same rotation is applied for all particles within a given collision cell, but the direction (axis) of rotation is statistically independent both between all cells and for a given cell in time.
If the structure of the collision grid defined by the positions of the collision cells is fixed, Galilean invariance is violated. It is restored with the introduction of a random shift of the collision grid.[4]
Explicit expressions for the diffusion coefficient and viscosity derived based on Green-Kubo relations are in excellent agreement with simulations.[5][6]
The set of parameters for the simulation of the solvent are:
The simulation parameters define the solvent properties,[1] such as
