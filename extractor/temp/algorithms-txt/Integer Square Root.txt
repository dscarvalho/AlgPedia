FULL TEXT
In number theory, the integer square root (isqrt) of a positive integer n is the positive integer m which is the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of n,
For example, 




isqrt

(
27
)
=
5


{\displaystyle {\mbox{isqrt}}(27)=5}

 because 



5
⋅
5
=
25
≤
27


{\displaystyle 5\cdot 5=25\leq 27}

 and 



6
⋅
6
=
36
>
27


{\displaystyle 6\cdot 6=36>27}

.


One way of calculating 





n




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}}

 and 




isqrt

(
n
)


{\displaystyle {\mbox{isqrt}}(n)}

 is to use Newton's method to find a solution for the equation 




x

2


−
n
=
0


{\displaystyle x^{2}-n=0}

, giving the iterative formula
The sequence 



{

x

k


}


{\displaystyle \{x_{k}\}}

 converges quadratically to 





n




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}}

 as 



k
→
∞


{\displaystyle k\to \infty }

. It can be proven that if 




x

0


=
n


{\displaystyle x_{0}=n}

 is chosen as the initial guess, one can stop as soon as
to ensure that 



⌊

x

k
+
1


⌋
=
⌊


n


⌋
.


{\displaystyle \lfloor x_{k+1}\rfloor =\lfloor {\sqrt {n}}\rfloor .}


For computing 



⌊


n


⌋


{\displaystyle \lfloor {\sqrt {n}}\rfloor }

 for very large integers n, one can use the quotient of Euclidean division for both of the division operations. This has the advantage of only using integers for each intermediate value, thus making the use of floating point representations of large numbers unnecessary. It is equivalent to using the iterative formula
By using the fact that
one can show that this will reach 



⌊


n


⌋


{\displaystyle \lfloor {\sqrt {n}}\rfloor }

 within a finite number of iterations.
However, 



⌊


n


⌋


{\displaystyle \lfloor {\sqrt {n}}\rfloor }

 is not necessarily a fixed point of the above iterative formula. Indeed, it can be shown that 



⌊


n


⌋


{\displaystyle \lfloor {\sqrt {n}}\rfloor }

 is a fixed point if and only if 



n
+
1


{\displaystyle n+1}

 is not a perfect square. If 



n
+
1


{\displaystyle n+1}

 is a perfect square, the sequence ends up in a period-two cycle between 



⌊


n


⌋


{\displaystyle \lfloor {\sqrt {n}}\rfloor }

 and 



⌊


n


⌋
+
1


{\displaystyle \lfloor {\sqrt {n}}\rfloor +1}

 instead of converging.
Although 





n




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}}

 is irrational for many 



n


{\displaystyle n}

, the sequence 



{

x

k


}


{\displaystyle \{x_{k}\}}

 contains only rational terms when 




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}

 is rational. Thus, with this method it is unnecessary to exit the field of rational numbers in order to calculate 




isqrt

(
n
)


{\displaystyle {\mbox{isqrt}}(n)}

, a fact which has some theoretical advantages.
One can prove that 



c
=
1


{\displaystyle c=1}

 is the largest possible number for which the stopping criterion
ensures 



⌊

x

k
+
1


⌋
=
⌊


n


⌋


{\displaystyle \lfloor x_{k+1}\rfloor =\lfloor {\sqrt {n}}\rfloor }

 in the algorithm above.
In implementations which use number formats that cannot represent all rational numbers exactly (for example, floating point), a stopping constant less than one should be used to protect against roundoff errors.
