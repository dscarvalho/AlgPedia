In a binary alphabet made of

, if a

{\displaystyle (n,1)}

 repetition code is used, then each input bit is mapped to the code word as a string of 



n


{\displaystyle n}

-replicated input bits. Generally

{\displaystyle n=2t+1}

, an odd number.
The repetition codes can detect up to

{\displaystyle [n/2]}

 transmission errors. Decoding errors occur when the more than these transmission errors occur. Thus, assuming bit-transmission errors are independent, the probability of error for a repetition code is given by
