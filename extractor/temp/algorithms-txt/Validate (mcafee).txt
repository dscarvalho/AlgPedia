FULL TEXT
The Validate program by McAfee Associates is used to provide checksum data for computer programs and data files.
It is commonly used to verify that shareware applications written for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows based platforms have not been altered during distribution, (as would be the case if somehow the files had become infected with a computer virus).
