Prony analysis (Prony's method) was developed by Gaspard Riche de Prony in 1795. However, practical use of the method awaited the digital computer.[1] Similar to the Fourier transform, Prony's method extracts valuable information from a uniformly sampled signal and builds a series of damped complex exponentials or sinusoids. This allows for the estimation of frequency, amplitude, phase and damping components of a signal.


Let 



f
(
t
)


{\displaystyle f(t)}

 be a signal consisting of 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 evenly spaced samples. Prony's method fits a function
to the observed 



f
(
t
)


{\displaystyle f(t)}

. After some manipulation utilizing Euler's formula, the following result is obtained. This allows more direct computation of terms.
where:
Prony's method is essentially a decomposition of a signal with 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 complex exponentials via the following process:
Regularly sample 






f

{\displaystyle {\hat {f}}(t)}

 so that the 



n

-th of 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 samples may be written as
If 






f

(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {f}}(t)}

 happens to consist of damped sinusoids, then there will be pairs of complex exponentials such that
where
Because the summation of complex exponentials is the homogeneous solution to a linear difference equation, the following difference equation will exist:
The key to Prony's Method is that the coefficients in the difference equation are related to the following polynomial:
These facts lead to the following three steps to Prony's Method:
1) Construct and solve the matrix equation for the 




P

m




{\displaystyle P_{m}}

 values:
Note that if 



N
≠
2
M


{\displaystyle N\neq 2M}

, a generalized matrix inverse may be needed to find the values 




P

m




{\displaystyle P_{m}}

.
2) After finding the 




P

m




{\displaystyle P_{m}}

 values find the roots (numerically if necessary) of the polynomial
The 



m


{\displaystyle m}

-th root of this polynomial will be equal to 




e


λ

m






{\displaystyle e^{\lambda _{m}}}

.
3) With the 




e


λ

m






{\displaystyle e^{\lambda _{m}}}

 values the 




F

n




{\displaystyle F_{n}}

 values are part of a system of linear equations that may be used to solve for the 





B


m




{\displaystyle \mathrm {B} _{m}}

 values:
where 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 unique values 




k

i




{\displaystyle k_{i}}

 are used. It is possible to use a generalized matrix inverse if more than 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 samples are used.
Note that solving for 




λ

m




{\displaystyle \lambda _{m}}

 will yield ambiguities, since only 




e

m






{\displaystyle e^{\lambda _{m}}}

 was solved for, and
