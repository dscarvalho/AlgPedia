The bandwidth-expanded filter can be expressed as:
In other words, each coefficient

{\displaystyle a_{k}}

 in the original filter is simply multiplied by 




γ

k




{\displaystyle \gamma ^{k}}

 in the bandwidth-expanded filter. The simplicity of this transformation makes it attractive, especially in CELP coding of speech, where it is often used for the perceptual noise weighting and/or to stabilize the LPC analysis. However, when it comes to stabilizing the LPC analysis, lag windowing is often preferred to bandwidth expansion.
