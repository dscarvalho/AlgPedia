 in a block basis that segments the time axis in intervals with sizes that are adapted to the signal structures.


Block orthonormal bases are obtained by dividing the time axis in consecutive intervals

The size

{\displaystyle \langle g_{p,k},g_{q,k}\rangle =0}

 since their supports do not overlap. Thus, the family

{\displaystyle \{g_{p,k}(t)=g_{p}(t){\frac {1}{\sqrt {l_{p}}}}e_{k}({\frac {t-a_{p}}{l_{p}}})\}_{(p,k)\in \mathbb {Z} }}

 Because of this poor frequency localization, even though a signal 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 is smooth, its decomposition in a block Fourier basis may include large high-frequency coefficients. This can also be interpreted as an effect of periodization.
For all 



p
∈

Z



{\displaystyle p\in \mathbb {Z} }

, we suppose that 




a

p


∈

Z



{\displaystyle a_{p}\in \mathbb {Z} }

. Discrete block bases are built with discrete rectangular windows having supports on intervals 



[

{\displaystyle g_{p}[n]=1_{[a_{p},a_{p+1}-1]}(n)}

.
Since dilations are not defined in a discrete framework,we generally cannot derive bases of intervals of varying sizes from a single basis. Thus,Theorem 2. supposes that we can construct an orthonormal basis of 





C


l




{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{l}}

 for any 



l

0


{\displaystyle l>0}

. The proof is straightforward.
Suppose that

{\displaystyle \{e_{k,l}\}_{0\leqslant k<l}}

The resulting block Fourier vectors 




g

p
,
k




{\displaystyle g_{p,k}}

 have sharp transitions at the window border, and thus are not well localized in frequency. As in the continuous case, the decomposition of smooth signals 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 may produce large-amplitude, high-frequency coefficients because of border effects.
General block bases of images are constructed by partitioning the plane
