ABOUT
The Recursive least squares (RLS) is an adaptive filter which recursively finds the coefficients that minimize a weighted linear least squares cost function relating to the input signals. This is in contrast to other algorithms such as the least mean squares (LMS) that aim to reduce the mean square error. In the derivation of the RLS, the input signals are considered deterministic, while for the LMS and similar algorithm they are considered stochastic. Compared to most of its competitors, the RLS exhibits extremely fast convergence. However, this benefit comes at the cost of high computational complexity.

The Recursive least squares (RLS) is an adaptive filter which recursively finds the coefficients that minimize a weighted linear least squares cost function relating to the input signals. This is in contrast to other algorithms such as the least mean squares (LMS) that aim to reduce the mean square error. In the derivation of the RLS, the input signals are considered deterministic, while for the LMS and similar algorithm they are considered stochastic. Compared to most of its competitors, the RLS exhibits extremely fast convergence. However, this benefit comes at the cost of high computational complexity.


RLS was discovered by Gauss but laid unused or ignored until 1950 when Plackett rediscovered the original work of Gauss from 1821. In general, the RLS can be used to solve any problem that can be solved by adaptive filters. For example, suppose that a signal d(n) is transmitted over an echoey, noisy channel that causes it to be received as

. Our goal is to estimate the parameters of the filter 




w



{\displaystyle \mathbf {w} }

, and at each time n we refer to the new least squares estimate by 





w

{\displaystyle \mathbf {w} _{n}}

. As time evolves, we would like to avoid completely redoing the least squares algorithm to find the new estimate for

The benefit of the RLS algorithm is that there is no need to invert matrices, thereby saving computational power. Another advantage is that it provides intuition behind such results as the Kalman filter.
The idea behind RLS filters is to minimize a cost function 



C

 by appropriately selecting the filter coefficients 





w

{\displaystyle \mathbf {w} _{n}}

, updating the filter as new data arrives. The error signal 



e

{\displaystyle e(n)}

 and desired signal 



d

n
)


{\displaystyle d(n)}

 are defined in the negative feedback diagram below:

The error implicitly depends on the filter coefficients through the estimate

—the cost function we desire to minimize—being a function of e(n) is therefore also dependent on the filter coefficients:

 is the "forgetting factor" which gives exponentially less weight to older error samples.
The cost function is minimized by taking the partial derivatives for all entries

 and setting the results to zero
Next, replace

Rearranging the equation yields
This form can be expressed in terms of matrices
where 





R

{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{dx}(n)}

 is the equivalent estimate for the cross-covariance between 



d

{\displaystyle d(n)}

 and 



x
(

)


{\displaystyle x(n)}

. Based on this expression we find the coefficients which minimize the cost function as
This is the main result of the discussion.
The smaller 



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }

 is, the smaller is the contribution of previous samples to the covariance matrix. This makes the filter more sensitive to recent samples, which means more fluctuations in the filter co-efficients. The 



λ
=
1


{\displaystyle \lambda =1}

 case is referred to as the growing window RLS algorithm. In practice, 



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }

 is usually chosen between 0.98 and 1.[1] By using type-II maximum likelihood estimation the optimal 



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }

 can be estimated from a set of data.[2]
The discussion resulted in a single equation to determine a coefficient vector which minimizes the cost function. In this section we want to derive a recursive solution of the form

In order to generate the coefficient vector we are interested in the inverse of the deterministic auto-covariance matrix. For that task the Woodbury matrix identity comes in handy. With
The Woodbury matrix identity follows
To come in line with the standard literature, we define

Before we move on, it is necessary to bring 




g

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (n)}

 into another form
Subtracting the second term on the left side yields
With the recursive definition of

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (n)}

 the desired form follows
Now we are ready to complete the recursion. As discussed
The second step follows from the recursive definition of

That means we found the correction factor
This intuitively satisfying result indicates that the correction factor is directly proportional to both the error and the gain vector, which controls how much sensitivity is desired, through the weighting factor,

The RLS algorithm for a p-th order RLS filter can be summarized as

{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} (n)=\left[{\begin{matrix}x(n)\\x(n-1)\\\vdots \\x(n-p)\end{matrix}}\right]}


Note that the recursion for 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 follows an Algebraic Riccati equation and thus draws parallels to the Kalman filter.[3]
The Lattice Recursive Least Squares adaptive filter is related to the standard RLS except that it requires fewer arithmetic operations (order N). It offers additional advantages over conventional LMS algorithms such as faster convergence rates, modular structure, and insensitivity to variations in eigenvalue spread of the input correlation matrix. The LRLS algorithm described is based on a posteriori errors and includes the normalized form. The derivation is similar to the standard RLS algorithm and is based on the definition of 



d
(
k
)




{\displaystyle d(k)\,\!}

. In the forward prediction case, we have 



d
(
k
)
=
x
(
k
)




{\displaystyle d(k)=x(k)\,\!}

 with the input signal 



x
(
k
−
1
)




{\displaystyle x(k-1)\,\!}

 as the most up to date sample. The backward prediction case is 



d
(
k
)
=
x
(
k
−
i
−
1
)




{\displaystyle d(k)=x(k-i-1)\,\!}

, where i is the index of the sample in the past we want to predict, and the input signal 



x
(
k
)




{\displaystyle x(k)\,\!}

 is the most recent sample.[4]
The algorithm for a LRLS filter can be summarized as
The normalized form of the LRLS has fewer recursions and variables. It can be calculated by applying a normalization to the internal variables of the algorithm which will keep their magnitude bounded by one. This is generally not used in real-time applications because of the number of division and square-root operations which comes with a high computational load.
