In abstract algebra, especially in the area of group theory, a strong generating set of a permutation group is a generating set that clearly exhibits the permutation structure as described by a stabilizer chain. A stabilizer chain is a sequence of subgroups, each containing the next and each stabilizing one more point.
Let 



G
≤

S

n




{\displaystyle G\leq S_{n}}

 be a group of permutations of the set 



{
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
}
.


{\displaystyle \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}.}

 Let
be a sequence of distinct integers, 




β

i


∈
{
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
}
,


{\displaystyle \beta _{i}\in \{1,2,\ldots ,n\},}

 such that the pointwise stabilizer of 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is trivial (i.e., let 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 be a base for 



G


{\displaystyle G}

). Define
and define 




G

(
i
)




{\displaystyle G^{(i)}}

 to be the pointwise stabilizer of 




B

i




{\displaystyle B_{i}}

. A strong generating set (SGS) for G relative to the base 



B


{\displaystyle B}

 is a set
such that
for each 



i


{\displaystyle i}

 such that 



1
≤
i
≤
r


{\displaystyle 1\leq i\leq r}

.
The base and the SGS are said to be non-redundant if
for 



i
≠
j


{\displaystyle i\neq j}

.
A base and strong generating set (BSGS) for a group can be computed using the Schreier–Sims algorithm.
