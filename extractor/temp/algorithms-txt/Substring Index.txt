ABOUT
In computer science, a substring index is a data structure which gives substring search in a text or text collection in sublinear time. If you have a document 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 of length 



n


{\displaystyle n}

, or a set of documents 



D
=
{

S

1


,

S

2


,
…
,

S

d


}


{\displaystyle D=\{S^{1},S^{2},\dots ,S^{d}\}}

 of total length 



n


{\displaystyle n}

, you can locate all occurrences of a pattern 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 in 



o
(
n
)


{\displaystyle o(n)}

 time. (See Big O notation.)

The phrase full-text index is also often used for an index of all substrings of a text. But is ambiguous, as it is also used for regular word indexes such as inverted files and document retrieval. See full text search.
