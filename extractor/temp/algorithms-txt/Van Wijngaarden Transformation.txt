Compute a row of partial sums :

The first column

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle s_{j,0}}

 then contains the partial sums of the Euler transform.
Adriaan van Wijngaarden's contribution was to point out that it is better not to carry this procedure through to the very end, but to stop two-thirds of the way.[1] If

This table results from the J formula 'b11.8'8!:2-:&(}:+}.)^:n+/\(_1^n)*%1+2*n=.i.13 In many cases the diagonal terms do not converge in one cycle so process of averaging is to be repeated with diagonal terms by bringing them in a row. This will be needed in an geometric series with ratio -4. This process of successive averaging of the average of partial sum can be replaced by using formula to calculate the diagonal term.
