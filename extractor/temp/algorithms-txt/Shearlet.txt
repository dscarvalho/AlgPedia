. They are a natural extension of wavelets to accommodate the fact that multivariate functions are typically governed by anisotropic features such as edges in images, however, wavelets as isotropic objects are not capable of capturing such phenomena.
Shearlets are constructed by parabolic scaling, shearing and translation applied to a few generating functions. At fine scales, they are essentially supported within skinny and directional ridges following the parabolic scaling law, which reads length² ≈ width. Similar to wavelets, shearlets arise from the affine group and allow a unified treatment of the continuum and digital situation leading to faithful implementations. Although they do not constitute an orthonormal basis for

, they still form a frame allowing stable expansions of arbitrary functions

.
One of the most important properties of shearlets is the fact that they provide optimally sparse approximations (in the sense of optimality in [2]) for cartoon-like functions 



f


{\displaystyle f}

. In imaging sciences, cartoon-like functions serve as a model for anisotropic features and are compactly supported in

where the constant

Shearlets are to date the only directional representation system which provides sparse approximation of anisotropic features while providing a unified treatment of the continuum and digital realm in the sense of allowing faithful implementation. Extensions of shearlet systems to

 are also available. A comprehensive presentation of the theory and applications of shearlets can be found in: [5]


The construction of continuous shearlet systems is based on parabolic scaling matrices
as a mean to change the resolution, on shear matrices
as a means to change the orientation, and finally on translations to change the positioning. In comparison to curvelets, shearlets use shearings instead of rotations, the advantage being that the shear operator

, i.e.,

{\displaystyle S_{s}\mathbb {Z} ^{2}\subseteq \mathbb {Z} ^{2}.}

 This indeed allows a unified treatment of the continuum and digital realm, thereby guaranteeing a faithful digital implementation.
For

{\displaystyle \psi \in L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ^{2})}

 the continuous shearlet system generated by

 is then defined as

From this, the discrete shearlet system associated with the shearlet generator

and the associated discrete shearlet transform is defined by
Let

is called a classical shearlet. It can be shown that the corresponding discrete shearlet system 



SH

(
ψ

{\displaystyle \operatorname {SH} (\psi )}

 constitutes a Parseval frame for 




L

2


(


R


2


)


{\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ^{2})}

 consisting of bandlimited functions.[5]
Another example are compactly supported shearlet systems, where a compactly supported function 



ψ
∈

L

2


(


R


2


)


{\displaystyle \psi \in L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ^{2})}

 can be chosen so that 



SH

(

{\displaystyle \operatorname {SH} (\psi )}

 forms a frame for 




L

2


(


R


2


)


{\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ^{2})}

.[4][6][7][8] In this case, all shearlet elements in 



SH
⁡
(
ψ
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {SH} (\psi )}

 are compactly supported providing superior spatial localization compared to the classical shearlets, which are bandlimited. Although a compactly supported shearlet system does not generally form a Parseval frame, any function 



f
∈

L

2


(


R


2


)


{\displaystyle f\in L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ^{2})}

 can be represented by the shearlet expansion due to its frame property.
One drawback of shearlets defined as above is the directional bias of shearlet elements associated with large shearing parameters. This effect is already recognizable in the frequency tiling of classical shearlets (see Figure in Section #Examples), where the frequency support of a shearlet increasingly aligns along the 




ξ

2




{\displaystyle \xi _{2}}

-axis as the shearing parameter 



s


{\displaystyle s}

 goes to infinity. This causes serious problems when analyzing a function whose Fourier transform is concentrated around the 




ξ

2




{\displaystyle \xi _{2}}

-axis.
To deal with this problem, the frequency domain is divided into a low-frequency part and two conic regions (see Figure):
The associated cone-adapted discrete shearlet system consists of three parts, each one corresponding to one of these frequency domains. It is generated by three functions
