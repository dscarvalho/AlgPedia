In signal processing, the adjoint filter mask 




h

∗




{\displaystyle h^{*}}

 of a filter mask 



h


{\displaystyle h}

 is reversed in time and the elements are complex conjugated.
Its name is derived from the fact, that the convolution with the adjoint filter is the adjoint operator of the original filter with respect to the Hilbert space 




ℓ

{\displaystyle \ell _{2}}

 of the sequences with respect to the Euclidean norm.
The autocorrelation of a signal
