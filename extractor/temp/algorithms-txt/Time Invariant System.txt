A time-invariant (TIV) system is a system whose output does not depend explicitly on time. Such systems are regarded as a class of systems in the field of system analysis. Lack of time dependence is captured in the following mathematical property of such a system:
This property can be satisfied if the transfer function of the system is not a function of time except expressed by the input and output.
In the context of a system schematic, this property can also be stated as follows:
If a time-invariant system is also linear, it is the subject of LTI system theory (linear time-invariant) with direct applications in NMR spectroscopy, seismology, circuits, signal processing, control theory, and other technical areas. Nonlinear time-invariant systems lack a comprehensive, governing theory. Discrete time-invariant systems are known as shift-invariant systems. Systems which lack the time-invariant property are studied as time-variant systems.


To demonstrate how to determine if a system is time-invariant, consider the two systems:
Since system A explicitly depends on t outside of 



x
(
t
)


{\displaystyle x(t)}

 and 



y
(
t
)


{\displaystyle y(t)}

, it is not time-invariant. System B, however, does not depend explicitly on t so it is time-invariant.
A more formal proof of why systems A and B above differ is now presented. To perform this proof, the second definition will be used.
System A:
System B:
We can denote the shift operator by 





T


r




{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{r}}

 where 



r


{\displaystyle r}

 is the amount by which a vector's index set should be shifted. For example, the "advance-by-1" system
can be represented in this abstract notation by
where 






x
~





{\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}}

 is a function given by
with the system yielding the shifted output
So 





T


1




{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{1}}

 is an operator that advances the input vector by 1.
Suppose we represent a system by an operator 




H



{\displaystyle \mathbb {H} }

. This system is time-invariant if it commutes with the shift operator, i.e.,
If our system equation is given by
then it is time-invariant if we can apply the system operator 




H



{\displaystyle \mathbb {H} }

 on 






x

{\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}}

 followed by the shift operator

{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{r}}

, or we can apply the shift operator

{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} _{r}}
