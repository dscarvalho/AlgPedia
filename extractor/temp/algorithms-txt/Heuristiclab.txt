ABOUT
HeuristicLab [1][2] is a software environment for heuristic and evolutionary algorithms, developed by members of the Heuristic and Evolutionary Algorithm Laboratory (HEAL) at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Campus Hagenberg. HeuristicLab has a strong focus on providing a graphical user interface so that users are not required to have comprehensive programming skills to adjust and extend the algorithms for a particular problem. In HeuristicLab algorithms are represented as operator graphs and changing or rearranging operators can be done by drag-and-drop without actually writing code. The software thereby tries to shift algorithm development capability from the software engineer to the user and practitioner. Developers can still extend the functionality on code level and can use HeuristicLab's plug-in mechanism that allows them to integrate custom algorithms, solution representations or optimization problems.

Development on HeuristicLab was started in 2002 by Stefan Wagner and Michael Affenzeller. The main motivation for the development of HeuristicLab was to build a paradigm-independent, flexible, extensible, and comfortable environment for heuristic optimization on top of a state-of-the-art programming environment and by using modern programming concepts. As the Microsoft .NET framework seemed to fulfill this requirements it was chosen as the development environment and C# as programming language. The first officially available version of HeuristicLab was 1.0 released in 2004 with an improved version 1.1 released in 2005. Development on the next version of HeuristicLab started in the same year. Among many things it was decided that HeuristicLab 2.0 should provide an entirely new user experience and lift the burden of programming off of the user. Therefore, HeuristicLab 2.0 was the first version featuring graphical tools for creating algorithms, however due to the complexity of the user interface HeuristicLab 2.0 was never released to the public. In the summer of 2007 it was decided that a new iteration of HeuristicLab was needed which should combine the usability of version 1.1 with the algorithm modeling concepts of version 2.0. HeuristicLab 3.0 was released internally in the beginning of 2008. In the next 2 years HeuristicLab was gradually improved which led to the release of version 3.3 in summer 2010 as open source software. Since then releases are done on a regular basis every three to six months.
