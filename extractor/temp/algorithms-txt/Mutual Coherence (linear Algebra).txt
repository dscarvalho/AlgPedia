 The mutual coherence of A is then defined as[1][2]
A lower bound is [3]
A deterministic matrix with the mutual coherence almost meeting the lower bound can be constructed by Weil's theorem.[4]
The concept was introduced in a slightly less general framework by David Donoho and Xiaoming Huo,[5] and has since been used extensively in the field of sparse representations of signals. In particular, it is used as a measure of the ability of suboptimal algorithms such as matching pursuit and basis pursuit to correctly identify the true representation of a sparse signal.[1][2][6]
