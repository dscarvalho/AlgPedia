In signal processing, a comb filter adds a delayed version of a signal to itself, causing constructive and destructive interference. The frequency response of a comb filter consists of a series of regularly spaced notches, giving the appearance of a comb.


Comb filters are used in a variety of signal processing applications. These include:
In acoustics, comb filtering can arise in some unwanted ways. For instance, when two loudspeakers are playing the same signal at different distances from the listener, there is a comb filtering effect on the signal.[1] In any enclosed space, listeners hear a mixture of direct sound and reflected sound. Because the reflected sound takes a longer path, it constitutes a delayed version of the direct sound and a comb filter is created where the two combine at the listener.[2]
Comb filters exist in two different forms, feedforward and feedback; the names refer to the direction in which signals are delayed before they are added to the input.
Comb filters may be implemented in discrete time or continuous time; this article will focus on discrete-time implementations; the properties of the continuous-time comb filter are very similar.
The general structure of a feedforward comb filter is shown on the right. It may be described by the following difference equation:
where 



K


{\displaystyle K}

 is the delay length (measured in samples), and 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 is a scaling factor applied to the delayed signal. If we take the Z transform of both sides of the equation, we obtain:
We define the transfer function as:
To obtain the frequency response of a discrete-time system expressed in the Z domain, we make the substitution 



z
=

e

j
Ω




{\displaystyle z=e^{j\Omega }}

. Therefore, for our feedforward comb filter, we get:
Using Euler's formula, we find that the frequency response is also given by
Often of interest is the magnitude response, which ignores phase. This is defined as:
In the case of the feedforward comb filter, this is:
Notice that the

 term is constant, whereas the

{\displaystyle 2\alpha \cos(\Omega K)}

 term varies periodically. Hence the magnitude response of the comb filter is periodic.
The graphs to the right show the magnitude response for various values of 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

, demonstrating this periodicity. Some important properties:
The feedforward comb filter is one of the simplest finite impulse response filters.[3] Its response is simply the initial impulse with a second impulse after the delay.
Looking again at the Z-domain transfer function of the feedforward comb filter:
we see that the numerator is equal to zero whenever 




z

K


=
−
α


{\displaystyle z^{K}=-\alpha }

. This has 



K


{\displaystyle K}

 solutions, equally spaced around a circle in the complex plane; these are the zeros of the transfer function. The denominator is zero at 




z

K


=
0


{\displaystyle z^{K}=0}

, giving 



K


{\displaystyle K}

 poles at 



z
=
0


{\displaystyle z=0}

. This leads to a pole–zero plot like the ones shown below.
Similarly, the general structure of a feedback comb filter is shown on the right. It may be described by the following difference equation:
If we rearrange this equation so that all terms in 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 are on the left-hand side, and then take the Z transform, we obtain:
The transfer function is therefore:
If we make the substitution 



z
=

e

j
Ω




{\displaystyle z=e^{j\Omega }}

 into the Z-domain expression for the feedback comb filter, we get:
The magnitude response is as follows:
Again, the response is periodic, as the graphs to the right demonstrate. The feedback comb filter has some properties in common with the feedforward form:
However, there are also some important differences because the magnitude response has a term in the denominator:
The feedback comb filter is a simple type of infinite impulse response filter.[4] If stable, the response simply consists of a repeating series of impulses decreasing in amplitude over time.
Looking again at the Z-domain transfer function of the feedback comb filter:
This time, the numerator is zero at 




z

K


=
0


{\displaystyle z^{K}=0}

, giving 



K


{\displaystyle K}

 zeros at 



z
=
0


{\displaystyle z=0}

. The denominator is equal to zero whenever 




z

K


=
α


{\displaystyle z^{K}=\alpha }

. This has 



K


{\displaystyle K}

 solutions, equally spaced around a circle in the complex plane; these are the poles of the transfer function. This leads to a pole–zero plot like the ones shown below.
Comb filters may also be implemented in continuous time. The feedforward form may be described by the following equation:
where 



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }

 is the delay (measured in seconds). This has the following transfer function:
The feedforward form consists of an infinite number of zeros spaced along the jω axis.
The feedback form has the equation:
and the following transfer function:
The feedback form consists of an infinite number of poles spaced along the jω axis.
Continuous-time implementations share all the properties of the respective discrete-time implementations.
