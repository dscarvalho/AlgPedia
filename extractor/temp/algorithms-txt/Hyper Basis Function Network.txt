In machine learning, a Hyper basis function network, or HyperBF network, is a generalization of radial basis function (RBF) networks concept, where the Mahalanobis-like distance is used instead of Euclidean distance measure. Hyper basis function networks were first introduced by Poggio and Girosi in the 1990 paper “Networks for Approximation and Learning”.[1][2]
The typical HyperBF network structure consists of a real input vector 



x

R


n




{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}

, a hidden layer of activation functions and a linear output layer. The output of the network is a scalar function of the input vector, 



ϕ

where 



N

 is a number of neurons in the hidden layer, 




μ

{\displaystyle \mu _{j}}

 and

 are the center and weight of neuron

 at the HyperBF network takes the following form
where

 are usually considered[3]
Training HyperBF networks involves estimation of weights

. Poggio and Girosi (1990) describe the training method with moving centers and adaptable neuron shapes. The outline of the method is provided below.

Overall, training HyperBF networks can be computationally challenging. Moreover, the high degree of freedom of HyperBF leads to overfitting and poor generalization. However, HyperBF networks have an important advantage that a small number of neurons is enough for learning complex functions.[2]
