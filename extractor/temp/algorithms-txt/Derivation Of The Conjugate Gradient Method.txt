FULL TEXT
In numerical linear algebra, the conjugate gradient method is an iterative method for numerically solving the linear system
where 




A



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {A}}}

 is symmetric positive-definite. The conjugate gradient method can be derived from several different perspectives, including specialization of the conjugate direction method for optimization, and variation of the Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration for eigenvalue problems.
The intent of this article is to document the important steps in these derivations.


The conjugate gradient method can be seen as a special case of the conjugate direction method applied to minimization of the quadratic function
In the conjugate direction method for minimizing
one starts with an initial guess 





x


0




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {x}}_{0}}

 and the corresponding residual 





r


0


=

b

−


A
x


0




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}_{0}={\boldsymbol {b}}-{\boldsymbol {Ax}}_{0}}

, and computes the iterate and residual by the formulae
where 





p

p


1

p

…


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{0},{\boldsymbol {p}}_{1},{\boldsymbol {p}}_{2},\ldots }

 are a series of mutually conjugate directions, i.e.,
for any 



i
≠
j


{\displaystyle i\neq j}

.
The conjugate direction method is imprecise in the sense that no formulae are given for selection of the directions 





p

…


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{0},{\boldsymbol {p}}_{1},{\boldsymbol {p}}_{2},\ldots }

. Specific choices lead to various methods including the conjugate gradient method and Gaussian elimination.
The conjugate gradient method can also be seen as a variant of the Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration applied to solving linear systems.
In the Arnoldi iteration, one starts with a vector 





r


0




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}_{0}}

 and gradually builds an orthonormal basis

{\displaystyle \{{\boldsymbol {v}}_{1},{\boldsymbol {v}}_{2},{\boldsymbol {v}}_{3},\ldots \}}

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{i}={\boldsymbol {w}}_{i}/\lVert {\boldsymbol {w}}_{i}\rVert _{2}}

 where
In other words, for 



i

{\displaystyle i>1}

, 





v

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{i}}

 is found by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalizing

{\displaystyle \{{\boldsymbol {v}}_{1},{\boldsymbol {v}}_{2},\ldots ,{\boldsymbol {v}}_{i-1}\}}

 followed by normalization.
Put in matrix form, the iteration is captured by the equation

When applying the Arnoldi iteration to solving linear systems, one starts with

, the residual corresponding to an initial guess

y


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {x}}_{i}={\boldsymbol {x}}_{0}+{\boldsymbol {V}}_{i}{\boldsymbol {y}}_{i}}

.
For the rest of discussion, we assume that 




A



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {A}}}

 is symmetric positive-definite. With symmetry of 




A



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {A}}}

, the upper Hessenberg matrix 





H


i


=


V


i



T





A
V


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {H}}_{i}={\boldsymbol {V}}_{i}^{\mathrm {T} }{\boldsymbol {AV}}_{i}}

 becomes symmetric and thus tridiagonal. It then can be more clearly denoted by
This enables a short three-term recurrence for 





v


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{i}}

 in the iteration, and the Arnoldi iteration is reduced to the Lanczos iteration.
Since 




A



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {A}}}

 is symmetric positive-definite, so is 





H


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {H}}_{i}}

. Hence, 





H


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {H}}_{i}}

 can be LU factorized without partial pivoting into
with convenient recurrences for 




c

{\displaystyle c_{i}}

 and 




d

{\displaystyle d_{i}}

It is now important to observe that
In fact, there are short recurrences for 





p


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{i}}

 and 




ζ

i




{\displaystyle \zeta _{i}}

 as well:
With this formulation, we arrive at a simple recurrence for 





x


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {x}}_{i}}

:
The relations above straightforwardly lead to the direct Lanczos method, which turns out to be slightly more complex.
If we allow 





p


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{i}}

 to scale and compensate for the scaling in the constant factor, we potentially can have simpler recurrences of the form:
As premises for the simplification, we now derive the orthogonality of 





r


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}_{i}}

 and conjugacy of 





p


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{i}}

, i.e., for 



i
≠
j


{\displaystyle i\neq j}

,
The residuals are mutually orthogonal because 





r


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}_{i}}

 is essentially a multiple of 





v

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{i+1}}

To see the conjugacy of 





p


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{i}}

, it suffices to show that 





P

P

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {P}}_{i}^{\mathrm {T} }{\boldsymbol {AP}}_{i}}

is symmetric and lower triangular simultaneously and thus must be diagonal.
Now we can derive the constant factors 




α

i




{\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}

 and 




β

i




{\displaystyle \beta _{i}}

 with respect to the scaled 





p


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{i}}

 by solely imposing the orthogonality of 





r


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}_{i}}

 and conjugacy of 





p


i




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{i}}

.
Due to the orthogonality of 





r

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}_{i}}

, it is necessary that

. As a result,
Similarly, due to the conjugacy of 





p

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}_{i}}

. As a result,
This completes the derivation.
