Consider a vector linear program
for 



P
∈


R


q
×
n




{\displaystyle P\in \mathbb {R} ^{q\times n}}

, 



A
∈


R


m
×
n




{\displaystyle A\in \mathbb {R} ^{m\times n}}

, 



b
∈


R


m




{\displaystyle b\in \mathbb {R} ^{m}}

 and a polyhedral convex ordering cone 



C


{\displaystyle C}

 having nonempty interior and containing no lines. The feasible set is 



S
=
{
x
∈


R


n


:

A
x
≥
b
}


{\displaystyle S=\{x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}:\;Ax\geq b\}}

. In particular, Benson's algorithm finds the extreme points of the set 



P
[
S
]
+
C


{\displaystyle P[S]+C}

, which is called upper image.[2]
In case of 



C
=


R


+


q


:=
{
y
∈


R


q


:

y

1


≥
0
,
…
,

y

q


≥
0
}


{\displaystyle C=\mathbb {R} _{+}^{q}:=\{y\in \mathbb {R} ^{q}:y_{1}\geq 0,\dots ,y_{q}\geq 0\}}

, one obtains the special case of a multi-objective linear program (multiobjective optimization).
