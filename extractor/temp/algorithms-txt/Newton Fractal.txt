It is relevant to numerical analysis because it shows that (outside the region of quadratic convergence) the Newton method can be very sensitive to its choice of start point.
Many points of the complex plane are associated with one of the 



deg

{\displaystyle \deg(p)}

 roots of the polynomial in the following way: the point is used as starting value

{\displaystyle z_{1},z_{2},\ldots ,}

 If the sequence converges to the root

, then

{\displaystyle z_{0}}

 was an element of the region

{\displaystyle G_{k}}

. However, for every polynomial of degree at least 2 there are points for which the Newton iteration does not converge to any root: examples are the boundaries of the basins of attraction of the various roots. There are even polynomials for which open sets of starting points fail to converge to any root: a simple example is 




z

−
2
z
+
2


{\displaystyle z^{3}-2z+2}

, where some points are attracted by the cycle 0, 1, 0, 1 ... rather than by a root.
An open set for which the iterations converge towards a given root or cycle (that is not a fixed point), is a Fatou set for the iteration. The complementary set to the union of all these, is the Julia set. The Fatou sets have common boundary, namely the Julia set. Therefore each point of the Julia set is a point of accumulation for each of the Fatou sets. It is this property that causes the fractal structure of the Julia set (when the degree of the polynomial is larger than 2).

A generalization of Newton's iteration is
where 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 is any complex number.[1] The special choice 



a
=
1


{\displaystyle a=1}

 corresponds to the Newton fractal. The fixed points of this map are stable when 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 lies inside the disk of radius 1 centered at 1. When 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 is outside this disk, the fixed points are locally unstable, however the map still exhibits a fractal structure in the sense of Julia set. If 



p


{\displaystyle p}

 is a polynomial of degree 



n


{\displaystyle n}

, then the sequence 




z

n




{\displaystyle z_{n}}

 is bounded provided that 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 is inside a disk of radius 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 centered at 



n

More generally, Newton's fractal is a special case of a Julia set.
