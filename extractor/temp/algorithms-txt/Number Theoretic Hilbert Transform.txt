The number theoretic transform is meaningful in the ring

 where I is the identity matrix.
The number theoretic Hilbert transform can be used to generate sets of orthogonal discrete sequences that have applications in signal processing, wireless systems, and cryptography.[2] Other ways to generate constrained orthogonal sequences also exist.[3][4]
