In computer science, FINO (Sometimes seen as "FISH", for First In, Still Here) is a humorous scheduling algorithm. It is an acronym for "First In Never Out" as opposed to traditional "first in first out" (FIFO) and "last in first out" (LIFO) algorithms.

In computer science, FINO (Sometimes seen as "FISH", for First In, Still Here) is a humorous scheduling algorithm. It is an acronym for "First In Never Out" as opposed to traditional "first in first out" (FIFO) and "last in first out" (LIFO) algorithms.
FINO works by withholding all scheduled tasks permanently. No matter how many tasks are scheduled at any time, no task ever actually takes place. This makes FINO extremely simple to implement, but useless in practice. A stateful FINO queue can be used to implement a memory leak.
A mention of FINO appears in the Signetics 25120 write-only memory joke datasheet.[1]
