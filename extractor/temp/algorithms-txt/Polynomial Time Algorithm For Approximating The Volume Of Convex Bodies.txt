The main result of the paper is a randomized algorithm for finding an

 approximation to the volume of a convex body 



K


{\displaystyle K}

 in 



n

-dimensional Euclidean space by assuming the existence of a membership oracle. The algorithm takes time bounded by a polynomial in

.
The algorithm is a sophisticated usage of the so-called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The basic scheme of the algorithm is a nearly uniform sampling from within

 by placing a grid consisting

-dimensional cubes and doing a random walk over these cubes. By using the theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains, they show that it takes a polynomial time for the random walk to settle down to being a nearly uniform distribution.
