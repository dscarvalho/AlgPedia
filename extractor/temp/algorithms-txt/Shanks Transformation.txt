In numerical analysis, the Shanks transformation is a non-linear series acceleration method to increase the rate of convergence of a sequence. This method is named after Daniel Shanks, who rediscovered this sequence transformation in 1955. It was first derived and published by R. Schmidt in 1941.[1]
One can calculate only a few terms of a perturbation expansion, usually no more than two or three, and almost never more than seven. The resulting series is often slowly convergent, or even divergent. Yet those few terms contain a remarkable amount of information, which the investigator should do his best to extract.
This viewpoint has been persuasively set forth in a delightful paper by Shanks (1955), who displays a number of amazing examples, including several from fluid mechanics.


For a sequence 





{

a

m


}


m
∈

N





{\displaystyle \left\{a_{m}\right\}_{m\in \mathbb {N} }}

 the series
is to be determined. First, the partial sum 




A

n




{\displaystyle A_{n}}

 is defined as:
and forms a new sequence 





{

A

n


}


n
∈

N





{\displaystyle \left\{A_{n}\right\}_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}

. Provided the series converges, 




A

n




{\displaystyle A_{n}}

 will also approach the limit 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 as 



n
→
∞
.


{\displaystyle n\to \infty .}

 The Shanks transformation 



S
(

A

n


)


{\displaystyle S(A_{n})}

 of the sequence 




A

n




{\displaystyle A_{n}}

 is the new sequence defined by[2][3]
where this sequence 



S
(

A

n


)


{\displaystyle S(A_{n})}

 often converges more rapidly than the sequence 




A

n


.


{\displaystyle A_{n}.}

 Further speed-up may be obtained by repeated use of the Shanks transformation, by computing 




S

{\displaystyle S^{2}(A_{n})=S(S(A_{n})),}

,


{\displaystyle S^{3}(A_{n})=S(S(S(A_{n}))),}

 etc.
Note that the non-linear transformation as used in the Shanks transformation is essentially the same as used in Aitken's delta-squared process so that as with Aitken's method, the right-most expression in 



S

{\displaystyle S(A_{n})}

{\displaystyle S(A_{n})=A_{n+1}-{\frac {(A_{n+1}-A_{n})^{2}}{(A_{n+1}-A_{n})-(A_{n}-A_{n-1})}}}

) is more numerically stable than the expression to its left (i.e.

{\displaystyle S(A_{n})={\frac {A_{n+1}\,A_{n-1}\,-\,A_{n}^{2}}{A_{n+1}-2A_{n}+A_{n-1}}}}

). Both Aitken's method and Shanks transformation operate on a sequence, but the sequence the Shanks transformation operates on is usually thought of as being a sequence of partial sums, although any sequence may be viewed as a sequence of partial sums.
As an example, consider the slowly convergent series[3]
which has the exact sum π ≈ 3.14159265. The partial sum 




A

6




{\displaystyle A_{6}}

 has only one digit accuracy, while six-figure accuracy requires summing about 400,000 terms.
In the table below, the partial sums 




A

n




{\displaystyle A_{n}}

, the Shanks transformation 



S
(

A

n


)


{\displaystyle S(A_{n})}

 on them, as well as the repeated Shanks transformations 




S

2


(

A

n


)


{\displaystyle S^{2}(A_{n})}

 and 




S

3


(

A

n


)


{\displaystyle S^{3}(A_{n})}

 are given for 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 up to 12. The figure to the right shows the absolute error for the partial sums and Shanks transformation results, clearly showing the improved accuracy and convergence rate.
The Shanks transformation 



S
(

A

1


)


{\displaystyle S(A_{1})}

 already has two-digit accuracy, while the original partial sums only establish the same accuracy at 




A

24


.


{\displaystyle A_{24}.}

 Remarkably, 




S

3


(

A

3


)


{\displaystyle S^{3}(A_{3})}

 has six digits accuracy, obtained from repeated Shank transformations applied to the first seven terms 




A

0




{\displaystyle A_{0}}

, ... , 




A

6


.


{\displaystyle A_{6}.}

 As said before, 




A

n




{\displaystyle A_{n}}

 only obtains 6-digit accuracy after about summing 400,000 terms.
The Shanks transformation is motivated by the observation that — for larger 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 — the partial sum 




A

n




{\displaystyle A_{n}}

 quite often behaves approximately as[2]
with 




|

q

|

<
1


{\displaystyle |q|<1}

 so that the sequence converges transiently to the series result 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 for 



n
→
∞
.


{\displaystyle n\to \infty .}

 So for 



n
−
1
,


{\displaystyle n-1,}

 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 and 



n
+
1


{\displaystyle n+1}

 the respective partial sums are:
These three equations contain three unknowns: 



A
,


{\displaystyle A,}

 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 and 



q
.


{\displaystyle q.}

 Solving for 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 gives[2]
In the (exceptional) case that the denominator is equal to zero: then 




A

n


=
A


{\displaystyle A_{n}=A}

 for all 



n
.


{\displaystyle n.}


The generalized kth-order Shanks transformation is given as the ratio of the determinants:[4]
with 



Δ

A

p


=

A

p
+

−

A

p


.


{\displaystyle \Delta A_{p}=A_{p+1}-A_{p}.}

 It is the solution of a model for the convergence behaviour of the partial sums 




A

n




{\displaystyle A_{n}}

 with 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 distinct transients:
This model for the convergence behaviour contains 



2
k
+
1


{\displaystyle 2k+1}

 unknowns. By evaluating the above equation at the elements

,
…
,

A

n
+
k




{\displaystyle A_{n-k},A_{n-k+1},\ldots ,A_{n+k}}

 and solving for 



A
,


{\displaystyle A,}

 the above expression for the kth-order Shanks transformation is obtained. The first-order generalized Shanks transformation is equal to the ordinary Shanks transformation: 




S

(

A

)
=
S
(

)
.


{\displaystyle S_{1}(A_{n})=S(A_{n}).}


The generalized Shanks transformation is closely related to Padé approximants and Padé tables.[4]
