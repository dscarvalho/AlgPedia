Stan is a probabilistic programming language for statistical inference written in C++.[1] The Stan language is used to specify a (Bayesian) statistical model with an imperative program calculating the log probability density function.[1]:2
Stan is licensed under the New BSD License. Stan is named in honour of Stanislaw Ulam, pioneer of the Monte Carlo method.[1]:xii


Stan can be accessed through several interfaces:
Stan implements gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian inference, stochastic, gradient-based variational Bayesian methods for approximate Bayesian inference, and gradient-based optimization for penalized maximum likelihood estimation.
Stan implements reverse-mode automatic differentiation to calculate gradients of the model, which is required by HMC, NUTS, L-BFGS, BFGS, and variational inference.[1]:199 The automatic differentiation within Stan can be used outside of the probabilistic programming language.
Stan is used in fields including social science[4] and pharmaceutical statistics.[5]
