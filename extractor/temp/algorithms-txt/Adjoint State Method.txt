FULL TEXT
The adjoint state method is a numerical method for efficiently computing the gradient of a function or operator in a numerical optimization problem. It has applications in geophysics and seismic imaging.
The adjoint state space is chosen to simplify the physical interpretation of equation constraints.[1] It may take the form of a Hilbert space.
Adjoint state techniques allow the use of integration by parts, resulting in a form which explicitly contains the physically interesting quantity. An adjoint state equation is introduced, including a new unknown variable.
The adjoint method formulates the gradient of a function towards its parameters in a constraint optimization form. By using the dual form of this constraint optimization problem, it can be used to calculate the gradient very fast. A nice property is that the number of computations is independent of the number of parameters for which you want the gradient. The adjoint method is derived from the dual problem [1] and is used i.e. in the Landweber iteration method [2].
The name adjoint state method refers to the dual form of the problem, where the adjoint matrix

{\displaystyle A^{*}={\overline {A}}^{T}}

 is used.
When the initial problem consists of calculating the product

{\displaystyle s^{T}x}

 and x must satisfy

{\displaystyle Ax=b}

, the dual problem can be realized as calculating the product
