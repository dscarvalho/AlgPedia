Given a transfer function,




G
(
s
)
=



Y
(
s
)


X
(
s
)





{\displaystyle G(s)={\frac {Y(s)}{X(s)}}}


with the closed-loop transfer function defined as,




M
(
s
)
=



G
(
s
)


1
+
G
(
s
)





{\displaystyle M(s)={\frac {G(s)}{1+G(s)}}}

 are overlaid to allow the designer to obtain the closed loop transfer function directly from the open loop transfer function. Thus, the frequency

{\displaystyle \omega }

 is the parameter along the curve. This plot may be compared to the Bode plot in which the two inter-related graphs -

In feedback control design, the plot is useful for assessing the stability and robustness of a linear system. This application of the Nichols plot is central to the Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) of Horowitz and Sidi, which is a well known method for robust control system design.
In most cases,

{\displaystyle \arg(G(s))}

 refers to the phase of the system's response. Although similar to a Nyquist plot, a Nichols plot is plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system while a Nyquist plot is plotted in a polar coordinate system.
