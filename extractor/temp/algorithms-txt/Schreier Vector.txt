In mathematics, especially the field of computational group theory, a Schreier vector is a tool for reducing the time and space complexity required to calculate orbits of a permutation group.


Suppose G is a finite group with generating sequence 



X
=
{

x

1


,

x

2


,
.

,

x

r


}


{\displaystyle X=\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{r}\}}

 which acts on the finite set 



Ω
=
{
1
,
2
,
.
.

,
n
}


{\displaystyle \Omega =\{1,2,...,n\}}

. A common task in computational group theory is to compute the orbit of some element 



ω
∈
Ω


{\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega }

 under G. At the same time, one can record a Schreier vector for 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

. This vector can then be used to find an element 



g
∈
G


{\displaystyle g\in G}

 satisfying 




ω

g


=
α


{\displaystyle \omega ^{g}=\alpha }

, for any 



α
∈

ω

G




{\displaystyle \alpha \in \omega ^{G}}

. Use of Schreier vectors to perform this requires less storage space and time complexity than storing these g explicitly.
All variables used here are defined in the overview.
