In statistics, the antithetic variates method is a variance reduction technique used in Monte Carlo methods. Considering that the error reduction in the simulated signal (using Monte Carlo methods) has a square root convergence, a very large number of sample paths is required to obtain an accurate result. The antithetic variates method reduces the variance of the simulation results.
The antithetic variates technique consists, for every sample path obtained, in taking its antithetic path — that is given a path

. The advantage of this technique is twofold: it reduces the number of normal samples to be taken to generate N paths, and it reduces the variance of the sample paths, improving the accuracy.

If the law of the variable X follows a uniform distribution along [0, 1], the first sample will be

The following table compares the classical Monte Carlo estimate (sample size: 2n, where n = 1500) to the antithetic variates estimate (sample size: n, completed with the transformed sample 1 − ui):
The use of the antithetic variates method to estimate the result shows an important variance reduction.
