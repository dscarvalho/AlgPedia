ABOUT
Orbit-Vis is an orbit simulation program which is designed to allow users to simulate a satellite in any orbit around the Earth, and to give the user data on the position and motion of the satellite in both visual and numerical form. It is based on information from the book 'Satellite Orbits - Models, Methods and Applications',[1] and is an example of an orbit propagation program utilising the Kepler Two-body problem for solving elliptical orbits.[2]

Orbit-Vis is an orbit simulation program which is designed to allow users to simulate a satellite in any orbit around the Earth, and to give the user data on the position and motion of the satellite in both visual and numerical form. It is based on information from the book 'Satellite Orbits - Models, Methods and Applications',[1] and is an example of an orbit propagation program utilising the Kepler Two-body problem for solving elliptical orbits.[2]
It uses the Graphics Device Interface to display the calculated orbit as it progresses.


The program features two major parts - the input and numerical display window, in which the user can enter a desired Apogee and Perigee and press the 'Launch!' button to begin the simulation, and which displays the numerical properties of the orbit in real time, and also the visual display, which consists of a sizeable window displaying the Earth and the orbiting object to scale. Also featured is a control panel which allows the user to manipulate the display window in real time.
The graphical display features double-buffering and the ability to update the inputs while the simulation is running, along with a moveable viewpoint and the ability to pause the simulation.
Version 2.0 also fixed various bugs and cleared up the interface.
