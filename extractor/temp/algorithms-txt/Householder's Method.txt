In mathematics, and more specifically in numerical analysis, Householder's methods are a class of root-finding algorithms that are used for functions of one real variable with continuous derivatives up to some order d+1. Each of these methods is characterized by the number d, which is known as the order of the method. The algorithm is iterative and has a rate of convergence of d+1.
These methods are named after the American mathematician Alston Scott Householder.


Householder's method is a numerical algorithm for solving the nonlinear equation f(x) = 0. In this case, the function f has to be a function of one real variable. The method consists of a sequence of iterations
beginning with an initial guess x0.[1]
If f is a (d+1) times continuously differentiable function and a is a zero of f but not of its derivative, then, in a neighborhood of a, the iterates xn satisfy:
This means that the iterates converge to the zero if the initial guess is sufficiently close, and that the convergence has order (d+1).
Despite their order of convergence, these methods are not widely used because the gain in precision is not commensurate with the rise in effort for large d. The Ostrowski index[2] expresses the error reduction in the number of function evaluations instead of the iteration count.
An approximate idea of Householder's method derives from the geometric series. Let the real-valued, continuously differentiable function f(x) have a simple zero at x=a, that is a root f(a)=0 of multiplicity one, which is equivalent to 




f
′

(
a
)
≠
0


{\displaystyle f'(a)\neq 0}

. Then 1/f(x) has a singularity at a, specifically a simple pole (also of multiplicity one), and close to a the behavior of 1/f(x) is dominated by 1/(x-a). Approximately one gets
Here 




f
′

(
a
)
≠
0


{\displaystyle f'(a)\neq 0}

 because a is a simple zero of f(x). The coefficient of degree d has the value 



C


a

−
d




{\displaystyle C\,a^{-d}}

. Thus, one can now reconstruct the zero a by dividing the coefficient of degree d-1 by the coefficient of degree d. Since this geometric series is an approximation to the Taylor expansion of 1/f(x), one can get estimates of the zero of f(x) − now without prior knowledge of the location of this zero − by dividing the corresponding coefficients of the Taylor expansion of 1/f(x) or, more generally, 1/f(b+x). From that one gets, for any integer d, and if the corresponding derivatives exist,
Suppose x=a is a simple root. Then near x=a, (1/f)(x) is a meromorphic function. Suppose we have the Taylor expansion:
By König's theorem, we have:
This suggests that Householder's iteration might be a good convergent iteration. The actual proof of the convergence is also based on this idea.
Householder's method of order 1 is just Newton's method, since:
For Householder's method of order 2 one gets Halley's method, since the identities

The third order method is obtained from the identity of the third order derivative of 1/f

The result of applying Householder's methods of various orders at x=0 is also obtained by dividing neighboring coefficients of the latter power series. For the first orders one gets the following values after just one iteration step: For an example, in the case of the 3rd order,

An exact derivation of Householder's methods starts from the Padé approximation of order (d+1) of the function, where the approximant with linear numerator is chosen. Once this has been achieved, the update for the next approximation results from computing the unique zero of the numerator.
The Padé approximation has the form
The rational function has a zero at

Just as the Taylor polynomial of degree d has d+1 coefficients that depend on the function f, the Padé approximation also has d+1 coefficients dependent on f and its derivatives. More precisely, in any Padé approximant, the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials have to add to the order of the approximant. Therefore,

One could determine the Padé approximant starting from the Taylor polynomial of f using Euclid's algorithm. However, starting from the Taylor polynomial of 1/f is shorter and leads directly to the given formula. Since
