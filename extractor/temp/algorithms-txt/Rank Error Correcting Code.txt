ABOUT
In coding theory, rank codes (also called Gabidulin codes) are non-binary[1] linear error-correcting codes over not Hamming but rank metric. They described a systematic way of building codes that could detect and correct multiple random rank errors. By adding redundancy with coding k-symbol word to a n-symbol word, a rank code can correct any errors of rank up to t = ⌊ (d − 1) / 2 ⌋, where d is a code distance. As an erasure code, it can correct up to d − 1 known erasures.

In coding theory, rank codes (also called Gabidulin codes) are non-binary[1] linear error-correcting codes over not Hamming but rank metric. They described a systematic way of building codes that could detect and correct multiple random rank errors. By adding redundancy with coding k-symbol word to a n-symbol word, a rank code can correct any errors of rank up to t = ⌊ (d − 1) / 2 ⌋, where d is a code distance. As an erasure code, it can correct up to d − 1 known erasures.
A rank code is an algebraic linear code over the finite field 



G
F
(

q

N


)


{\displaystyle GF(q^{N})}

 similar to Reed–Solomon code.
The rank of the vector over 



G
F
(

q

N


)


{\displaystyle GF(q^{N})}

 is the maximum number of linearly independent components over 



G
F
(
q
)


{\displaystyle GF(q)}

. The rank distance between two vectors over 



G
F
(

q

N


)


{\displaystyle GF(q^{N})}

 is the rank of the difference of these vectors.
The rank code corrects all errors with rank of the error vector not greater than t.

{\displaystyle u_{i}\in GF(q)}

 is a base of the vector space over the field

Every element

There is known the only construction of rank code, which is a maximum rank distance MRD-code with d = n − k + 1.

There are several proposals for public-key cryptosystems based on rank codes. However, most of them have been proven insecure (see e.g. Journal of Cryptology, April 2008[2]).
Rank codes are also useful for error and erasure correction in network coding.
