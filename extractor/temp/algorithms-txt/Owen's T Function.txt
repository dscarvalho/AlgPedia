In mathematics, Owen's T function T(h,Â a), named after statistician Donald Bruce Owen, is defined by
The function was first introduced by Owen in 1956.[1]


The function T(h,Â a) gives the probability of the event (X>h and 0<Y<a*X) where X and Y are independent standard normal random variables.
This function can be used to calculate bivariate normal distribution probabilities[2][3] and, from there, in the calculation of multivariate normal distribution probabilities.[4] It also frequently appears in various integrals involving Gaussian functions.
Computer algorithms for the accurate calculation of this function are available;[5] quadrature having been employed since the 1970s. [6]
Here Î¦(x) is the standard normal cumulative density function
More properties can be found in the literature.[7]
