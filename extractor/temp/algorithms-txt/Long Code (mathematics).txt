In theoretical computer science and coding theory, the long code is an error-correcting code that is locally decodable. Long codes have an extremely poor rate, but play a fundamental role in the theory of hardness of approximation.

k

{\displaystyle f_{1},\dots ,f_{2^{n}}:\{0,1\}^{k}\to \{0,1\}}

 for

n


{\displaystyle k=\log n}

 be the list of all functions from 



{
0
,
1

}

k


→
{

}


{\displaystyle \{0,1\}^{k}\to \{0,1\}}

. Then the long code encoding of a message 



x
∈
{
0
,
1

}

k




{\displaystyle x\in \{0,1\}^{k}}

 is the string

{\displaystyle f_{1}(x)\circ f_{2}(x)\circ \dots \circ f_{2^{n}}(x)}

 where 



∘


{\displaystyle \circ }

 denotes concatenation of strings. This string has length

n

k






{\displaystyle 2^{n}=2^{2^{k}}}

.
The Walsh-Hadamard code is a subcode of the long code, and can be obtained by only using functions 




f

i




{\displaystyle f_{i}}

 that are linear functions when interpreted as functions 





F

k

F

{\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{2}^{k}\to \mathbb {F} _{2}}

 on the finite field with two elements. Since there are only 




2

k




{\displaystyle 2^{k}}

 such functions, the block length of the Walsh-Hadamard code is 




2

k




{\displaystyle 2^{k}}

.
An equivalent definition of the long code is as follows: The Long code encoding of 



j
∈
[
n
]


{\displaystyle j\in [n]}

 is defined to be the truth table of the Boolean dictatorship function on the 



j


{\displaystyle j}

th coordinate, i.e., the truth table of 



f
:
{
0

1

}

n


→
{
0
,

}


{\displaystyle f:\{0,1\}^{n}\to \{0,1\}}

 with 



f
(

x

,
…
,

x

n


)
=

x

i




{\displaystyle f(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=x_{i}}

.[1] Thus, the Long code encodes a 



(
log
⁡
n
)


{\displaystyle (\log n)}

-bit string as a 




2

n




{\displaystyle 2^{n}}

-bit string.
The long code does not contain repetitions, in the sense that the function 




f

i




{\displaystyle f_{i}}

 computing the 



i


{\displaystyle i}

th bit of the output is different from any function 




f

j




{\displaystyle f_{j}}

 computing the 



j


{\displaystyle j}

th bit of the output for 



j
≠
i


{\displaystyle j\neq i}

. Among all codes that do not contain repetitions, the long code has the longest possible output. Moreover, it contains all non-repeating codes as a subcode.
