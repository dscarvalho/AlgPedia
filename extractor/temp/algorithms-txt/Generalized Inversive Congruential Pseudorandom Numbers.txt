. Then straightforward calculations and Fermat's Theorem yield
which implies the desired result.
Generalized Inversive Congruential Pseudorandom Numbers are well equidistributed in one dimension. A reliable theoretical approach for assessing their statistical independence properties is based on the discrepancy of s-tuples of pseudorandom numbers.
We use the notation

For a fixed number r of prime factors of m, Theorem 2 shows that

{\displaystyle D_{m}^{(s)}=O(m^{-1/2}(\log m)^{s})}

 for any Generalized Inversive Congruential Sequence. In this case Theorem 3 implies that there exist Generalized Inversive Congruential Generators having a discrepancy

{\displaystyle \textstyle \prod _{i=1}^{r}((p_{i}-3)/(p_{i}-1))^{1/2}\geqslant 2^{-r/2}}

 according to the law of the iterated logarithm for discrepancies.[2] In this sense, Generalized Inversive Congruential Pseudo-random Numbers model true random numbers very closely.
