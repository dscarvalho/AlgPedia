Examples of F include the set of integers \u2124, the real numbers \u211d, and set of complex numbers \u2102. The spaces Mmn(F) and Mpq(F) are different spaces if m and p are unequal, and if n and q are unequal; for instance M32(F) \u2260 M23(F). Two m\u00d7n matrices A and B in Mmn(F) can be added together to form another matrix in the space Mmn(F):\nand multiplied by a \u03b1 in F, to obtain another matrix in Mmn(F):\nCombining these two properties, a linear combination of matrices A and B are in Mmn(F) is another matrix in Mmn(F):\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are numbers in F.\nAny matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of basis matrices, which play the role of the basis vectors for the matrix space. For example, for the set of 2\u00d72 matrices over the field of real numbers, M22(\u211d), one legitimate basis set of matrices is:\nbecause any 2\u00d72 matrix can be expressed as:\nwhere a, b, c,d are all real numbers. This idea applies to other fields and matrices of higher dimensions.\nThe determinant of a square matrix is an important property. The determinant indicates if a matrix is invertible (i.e. the inverse of a matrix exists when the determinant is nonzero). Determinants are used for finding eigenvalues of matrices (see below), and for solving a system of linear equations (see Cramer's rule).\nAn n\u00d7n matrix A has eigenvectors x and eigenvalues \u03bb defined by the relation:\nIn words, the matrix multiplication of A followed by an eigenvector x (here an n-dimensional column matrix), is the same as multiplying the eigenvector by the eigenvalue. For an n\u00d7n matrix, there are n eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial:\nwhere I is the n\u00d7n identity matrix.\nRoots of polynomials, in this context the eigenvalues, can all be different, or some may be equal (in which case eigenvalue has multiplicity, the number of times an eigenvalue occurs). After solving for the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues can be found by the defining equation.\nTwo n\u00d7n matrices A and B are similar if they are related by a similarity transformation:\nThe matrix P is called a similarity matrix, and is necessarily invertible.\nLU decomposition splits a matrix into a matrix product of an upper triangular matrix and a lower triangle matrix.\nSince matrices form vector spaces, one can form axioms (analogous to those of vectors) to define a \"size\" of a particular matrix. The norm of a matrix is a positive real number.\nFor all matrices A and B in Mmn(F), and all numbers \u03b1 in F, a matrix norm, delimited by double vertical bars || ... ||, fulfills:[note 1]\nThe Frobenius norm is analogous to the dot product of Euclidean vectors; multiply matrix elements entry-wise, add up the results, then take the positive square root:\nIt is defined for matrices of any dimension (i.e. no restriction to square matrices).\nMatrix elements are not restricted to constant numbers, they can be mathematical variables.\nA functions of a matrix takes in a matrix, and return something else (a number, vector, matrix, etc...).\nA matrix valued function takes in something (a number, vector, matrix, etc...) and returns a matrix.",
