It is defined as the number of subsets of four leaves that are not related by the same topology in both trees.\nThe most straightforward computation of the quartet distance would require \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nN\n\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(N^{4})}\n\n time, where \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n is the number of leaves in the trees.\nFor binary trees, better algorithms have been found to compute the distance in\nand\nBrodal et al. found an algorithm that takes \n\n\n\nO\n(\nD\nN\nlog\n\u2061\nN\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(DN\\log N)}\n\n time to compute the quartet distance between two multifurcating trees when \n\n\n\nD\n\n\n{\\displaystyle D}\n\n is the maximum degree of the trees.[4]",
