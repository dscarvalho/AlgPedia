    "about": "A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) is an analytical instrument that measures the size and number concentration of aerosol particles with diameters from 2.5\u00a0nm to 1000\u00a0nm.[1] They employ a continuous, fast-scanning technique to provide high-resolution measurements.",

The instrument can be used for air quality measurement indoors, vehicle exhaust,[2] research in bioaerosols, atmospheric studies, and toxicology testing.",
