    "about": "Beam Stack Search[1] is a search algorithm that combines chronological backtracking (that is, depth-first search) with beam search and is similar to Depth-First Beam Search.[2] Both search algorithms are anytime algorithms that find good but likely sub-optimal solutions quickly, like beam search, then backtrack and continue to find improved solutions until convergence to an optimal solution.",
