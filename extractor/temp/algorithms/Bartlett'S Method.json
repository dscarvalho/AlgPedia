    "about": "In time series analysis, Bartlett's method (also known as the method of averaged periodograms[1]), is used for estimating power spectra. It provides a way to reduce the variance of the periodogram in exchange for a reduction of resolution, compared to standard periodograms.[2][3] A final estimate of the spectrum at a given frequency is obtained by averaging the estimates from the periodograms (at the same frequency) derived from a non-overlapping portions of the original series.",

Common applications of Bartlett's method are frequency response measurements and general spectrum analysis.\nThe method is named after M. S. Bartlett who first proposed it.[2][3]\n\n\nBartlett\u2019s method consists of the following steps:\nThe end result is an array of power measurements vs. frequency \"bin\".",
