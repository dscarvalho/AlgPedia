    "full_text": "An adaptive equalizer is an equalizer that automatically adapts to time-varying properties of the communication channel.[1] It is frequently used with coherent modulations such as phase shift keying, mitigating the effects of multipath propagation and Doppler spreading.\nMany adaptation strategies exist. They include:\nA well-known example is the decision feedback equalizer,[3][4] a filter that uses feedback of detected symbols in addition to conventional equalization of future symbols.[5] Some systems use predefined training sequences to provide reference points for the adaptation process.",
