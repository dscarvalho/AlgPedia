There are several estimation methods currently used in practice to efficiently estimate the spectral correlation for use in real-time analysis of signals due to its high computational complexity. Some of the more popular ones are the FFT Accumulation Method (FAM) and the Strip-Spectral Correlation Algorithm.[4] One method to calculate the spectral correlation density of a discrete-time signal \n\n\n\nx\n[\nn\n]\n\n\n{\\textstyle x[n]}\n\n with sample period \n\n\n\n\nT\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T_{s}}\n\n is to first calculate the sliding window discrete Fourier transform:\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nN\n\u2032\n\n\n\n(\nn\n,\nk\n)\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nr\n=\n\u2212\n\nN\n\u2032\n\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\nr\n=\n\nN\n\u2032\n\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\na\n[\nr\n]\nx\n[\nn\n\u2212\nr\n]\n\ne\n\n\u2212\nj\n2\n\u03c0\nk\n(\nn\n\u2212\nr\n)\n\nT\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{N'}(n,k)=\\sum _{r=-N'/2}^{r=N'/2}a[r]x[n-r]e^{-j2\\pi k(n-r)T_{s}}}\n\nThe variable N\u2032 determines the frequency resolution of the spectral correlation density and the function \n\n\n\na\n[\nn\n]\n\n\n{\\textstyle a[n]}\n\n is a window function of choice.
