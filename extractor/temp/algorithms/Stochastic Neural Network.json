This makes them useful tools for optimization problems, since the random fluctuations help it escape from local minima.\nAn example of a neural network using stochastic transfer functions is a Boltzmann machine. Each neuron is binary valued, and the chance of it firing depends on the other neurons in the network.\nStochastic neural networks have found applications in risk management, oncology, bioinformatics, and other similar fields.\n",
