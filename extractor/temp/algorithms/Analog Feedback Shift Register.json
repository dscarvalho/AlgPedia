    "full_text": "An analog feedback shift register (AFSR) is a generalization of the (binary, digital) linear feedback shift register (LFSR).\nWhile binary LFSRs require less power to generate spread-spectrum signals than AFSRs, AFSR receivers require less power (in theory) to synchronize to those signals than binary LFSR receivers.\nAs of 2005, AFSRs are still in research. AFSR techniques could make spread-spectrum receivers (such as GPS receivers and cell phones and WiFi receivers and RFIDs) cost less and have longer battery lifetimes.",
