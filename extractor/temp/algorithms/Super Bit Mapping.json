    "full_text": "Super Bit Mapping (SBM) is a noise shaping process, developed by Sony for CD mastering.[1]\nSony claims that the Super Bit Mapping process converts a 20-bit signal from master recording into a 16-bit signal nearly without sound quality loss, using noise shaping to improve signal to noise ratio over the frequency bands most acutely perceived by human hearing.[2]\nAudible quantization error is reduced by noise shaping the error according to an equal-loudness contour.[3]\nThis processing takes place in dedicated hardware inside the recording device. A similar process is used in Sony's DSD to PCM conversion and is called SBM Direct.",
