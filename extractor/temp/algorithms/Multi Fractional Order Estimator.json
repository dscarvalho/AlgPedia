The MFOE in[6] consisted of five point, 5th order processing of composite real (but altered for declassification) cruise missile data. A window of only 5 data points provided excellent maneuver following; whereas, 5th order processing included fractions of higher order terms to better approximate the complex maneuvering target trajectory. The MFOE overcomes the long-ago rejection of terms higher than 3rd order because, taken at full value (i.e., \n\n\n\n\nf\n\nm\n\n\ns\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{m}s=1}\n\n), estimator variances increase exponentially with linear order increases.

In the absence of process noise, the KF yields variances equivalent to these.[12][13] (A derivation of the variance from a 1st degree polynomial corresponding to \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n3\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{3}=\\rho _{3}=0}\n\n for the generalized case of arbitrary estimation time and sample times is given in reference.[11] In addition, establishing a multi-dimensional tracking gate at the predicted position can easily be aided with the simple approximation of the error function in.[14])\nTuning the KF consists of a trade-off between measurement noise and process noise to minimize the estimation error.[15][16] The KF process noise serves two roles: First, its covariance is sized to account for the maximum expected target acceleration. Second, process noise covariance establishes an effective recursive data window (analogous to the non-recursive sliding data window), described by Brookner as the Kalman filter memory.[12]\nContrary to process noise covariance as a single independent parameter in the KF serving two roles, the FOE has the advantage of two separate independent parameters: one for acceleration and the other for sizing the sliding data window. Therefore, as opposed to being limited to just two tuning parameters (process and measurement noises) as is the KF, the FOE includes three independent tuning parameters: measurement noise variance, the assumed maximum deterministic target acceleration (for simplicity both target acceleration and measurement noise are included in the ratio of the single parameter \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}}\n\n), and the number of samples in the data window.\nConsider tuning a 2nd order predictor applied to the simple and practical tracking example in[17] to minimize the MSE when the target acceleration is \n\n\n\n20\nm\n\n/\n\n\ns\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 20m/s^{2}}\n\n; the zero mean, stationary, and white measurement noise is described as \n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n=\n25\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sigma _{\\eta }=25m}\n\n; and \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n = 1 second.

This MSE is plotted as a function of N in Figure 1 along with both the variance and bias squared.\nClearly, only integer order steps are possible in a non-recursive estimator. However, for use in approximating the tuned 2nd order KF, this MSE plot is stepped in tenths of a unit to show more precisely where the minimum occurs. The minimum MSE of 4.09 occurs at N = 2.9. The tuned KF can be approximated by sizing the process noise covariance in the KF such that the effective recursive data window\u2014i.e., the Kalman filter memory[12]\u2014matches N = 2.9 in Figure 1 (i.e., \n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\u2248\n0.85\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha \\approx 0.85}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\u2248\n0.53\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta \\approx 0.53}\n\n), where \n\n\n\n\u03b1\n=\n\n\n\n4\nN\n\u2212\n2\n\n\nN\n(\nN\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha ={\\frac {4N-2}{N(N+1)}}}\n\nand \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n=\n\n\n6\n\nN\n(\nN\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta ={\\frac {6}{N(N+1)}}}\n\n.[13] This hints at the fallacy of using a 2nd order estimator on accelerating targets as described in.[18] Comparing this with the filtered position in[19] demonstrates that the minimum MSE is a function of the time \n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\n of the desired estimate.\nThe FOE can be viewed as a non-recursive multiple-model (MM) estimator composed of 2nd and 3rd order estimator models with the fraction \n\n\n\n0\n\u2264\n\nf\n\n3\n\n\n\u2264\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0\\leq f_{3}\\leq 1}\n\n as the interpolation factor.

After traveling at a constant velocity, the target accelerates at \n\n\n\n20\nm\n\n/\n\n\ns\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 20m/s^{2}}\n\n for 20 seconds and then continues again at a constant velocity.

Also shown are the 2nd order MSE as well as the 2nd and 3rd order MSEs (variances only since the bias is zero in each case) similar to those in Figure 2. There is a fifth curve not previously addressed: the variance portion of the optimal MSE. The variance also levels off for several increments of N like the \n\n\n\nM\nS\n\nE\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle MSE_{min}}\n\n. Both the variance and \n\n\n\nM\nS\n\nE\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle MSE_{min}}\n\n approach the 3rd order variance as \n\n\n\nN\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N\\to \\infty }\n\n.\nAs the acceleration varies from zero to maximum, the MSE is automatically adjusted (no external tinkering or adaptivity) between the variance at \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}=0}\n\n and maximum \n\n\n\nM\nS\n\nE\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle MSE_{min}}\n\n at \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n=\n0.4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}=0.4}\n\n.

On the other hand, choosing N = 8 yields the second curve in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 3, the optimal 8\u2013point FOE is essentially a 3rd order non-recursive estimator which yields less than 4% RMSE improvement over the optimal 4-point FOE in the case of no acceleration. However, in the case of maximum acceleration the optimal 8-point MSE is markedly volatile and has large error spikes that can confuse a tracker, one spike exceeding the optimal 4-point MSE for worst case acceleration by more than the optimal 4-point MSE exceeds the optimal 8-point MSE in the absence of acceleration. Obviously, higher values of N produce larger error spikes.\nSince trackers encounter greatest difficulties and often lose track during target maneuvers at maximum acceleration, the much smoother \n\n\n\nM\nS\n\nE\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle MSE_{min}}\n\ntransition of the optimal 4-point FOE has a major advantage over larger data windows.\nThe 4-point FOE in Figure 4 yields much smoother MSE transitions than the IMM (as well as the KF) in the parallel 1\u00a0Hz case of.[17] It produces no error spikes or volatility as do the 8-point FOE and the IMM. In this example only 4 multiplies, 3 adds, and a window shift are required to implement the 4-point FOE, significantly few operations than required by the IMM or KF. Similar comparisons of several additional MMs from the literature with the optimal FOE are made in[20]\nOf the KF based MMs, the interacting MM (IMM) is generally considered the state-of-the-art tracking model and usually the method of choice.[21][22] Since two model IMMs are most often used,[14] consider the following two models: 2nd and 3rd order KFs.

Therefore, this two model IMM is analogous to the optimal FOE in that it also interpolates between 2nd and 3rd order estimators. Two model IMM interpolation is formed during each recursive cycle involving the interactively produced model probabilities.[14][21][22][23][24]\nAs in the case of the FOE, this suggests a more descriptive estimate equal to the sum of the 2nd order KF plus the difference between the 3rd and 2nd order KFs times \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}(k)}\n\n\u00a0:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n^\n\n\n\n(\nk\n\n|\n\nk\n)\n=\n\n\n\n\nX\n^\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n(\nk\n\n|\n\nk\n)\n+\n[\n\n\n\n\nX\n^\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n(\nk\n\n|\n\nk\n)\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nX\n^\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n(\nk\n\n|\n\nk\n]\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\hat {X}}(k|k)={\\hat {X}}_{1}(k|k)+[{\\hat {X}}_{2}(k|k)-{\\hat {X}}_{1}(k|k]\\mu _{2}(k)}\n\n\nIn this formulation the difference between the 3rd and 2nd order KFs effectively augments the 2nd order KF with a fraction of the estimated target acceleration as a function of \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}(k)}\n\n\u2014as does \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{3}}\n\n in the FOE.\nOne major difference between the IMM and optimal FOE is that the IMM is not optimum. The IMM model probabilities and interpolation are based on likelihoods and ad hoc transition probabilities with no mechanism for minimizing the MSE.[19] Of course, not being optimum at any time increment k, the IMM cannot achieve the optimal FOE accuracy shown in Figure 2.\nMoveover, the IMM \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}(k)}\n\n fails to meet the boundary condition of zero to implement the 2nd order estimator in the absence of acceleration, which the FOE \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n3\n,\no\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{3,opt}}\n\n does. This results from the fact that the likelihoods do not sum to unity[25] even though the model probabilities do. This causes an IMM bias toward a non-existent acceleration and unnecessarily increases the MSE above the 2nd order variance. Another major difference between the IMM and FOE is that the IMM is adaptive whereas the FOE is not.\nIn order to make a reasonable comparison of the IMM with the FOE, reference[26] constructs a non-recursive IMM analogy (IMMA). It includes \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}(k)}\n\n which does go to zero allowing the 2nd order estimator to be implemented. Since the FOE is based on the actual acceleration not a noisy estimate, the acceleration estimate for the IMMA is assumed to be the expected value of the estimate, i.e., the actual acceleration. This is described here as the ideal for the purpose of illustration. These two modifications make the IMMA compatible for comparison with the FOE.\nThe \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}(k)}\n\n based on the expected value or actual acceleration (described here as the ideal \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}}\n\n where the k is dropped) then varies between zero and one in an S shaped curve as a function of \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}}\n\n, as does \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n3\n,\no\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{3,opt}}\n\n. This is shown in Figure 5, where a 4-point data window is assumed.\nTwo significant points of interest stand out as shown by the vertical lines. First, the largest deviation of the ideal \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}}\n\n from \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n3\n,\no\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{3,opt}}\n\n occurs near \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n=\n0.7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}=0.7}\n\n. Second, the two curves cross near \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n=\n1.4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}=1.4}\n\n.

The ideal IMMA MSE exceeds the FOE MSE most near \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n=\n0.7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}=0.7}\n\n, about where the \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}}\n\n differs most from \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n3\n,\no\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{3,opt}}\n\n in Figure 5. In addition, the ideal IMMA MSE exceeds the 3rd order variance most near \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n=\n0.85\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}=0.85}\n\n, even though the specific purpose of interpolation in the IMM is to produce an MSE smaller than the 3rd order variance. Nevertheless, as expected, the two MSE curves do osculate near \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n=\n1.4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}=1.4}\n\n, where \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n3\n,\no\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{3,opt}}\n\n cross in Figure 5.\nFurthermore, the MSE is exacerbated in the non-ideal IMMA by adaptivity, as shown in Figure 7 where the IMMA from noisy \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}}\n\n is superimposed on the curves in Figure 6 (although there is a slight change in scale to accommodate the larger noisy IMMA MSE). Reference[27] describes this in great detail. Clearly, since Figure 6 includes the ideal \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}}\n\n based on the expected value of acceleration, i.e., the actual acceleration; an estimate which includes measurement noise can only degrade the accuracy\u2014as shown in Figure 7.\nIndeed, not only is the noisy IMMA MSE larger than the 3rd order variance (by nearly a factor of two at the worst point), once the noisy IMMA MSE exceeds the 3rd order variance, it does not drop below as does the ideal IMMA. In contrast, the optimal FOE MSE (i.e., \n\n\n\nM\nS\n\nE\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle MSE_{min}}\n\n) always remains less than the 3rd order variance.\nThis analysis compellingly suggests that adaptivity significantly degrades IMM accuracy rather than improving it. Of course, this should not come as a surprise since for \n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n\n<\n0.5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho _{3}<0.5}\n\n , the acceleration is buried in the noise; i.e., \n\n\n\n(\na\n\n\u0394\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n/\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n<\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a\\Delta ^{2})/\\sigma _{\\eta }<1}\n\n (a signal-to-noise ratio likeness of less than 0\u00a0dB).\nThese analyses reveal the incredible and disconcerting lack of tracking literature that addresses fundamentals (e.g., optimal IMM interpolation, \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{2}}\n\n boundary conditions, and acceleration-to-noise ratio) and comparisons with standard benchmarks (e.g.; 2nd order, 3rd order, or other optimal estimators).\nComparisons of the KF with the derivation, analysis, design, and implementation of MFOE have uncovered a number of deficiencies and oversights in the KF that are overcome by the MFOE. They are reported and discussed in.[28]",
