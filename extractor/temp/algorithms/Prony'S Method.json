This allows for the estimation of frequency, amplitude, phase and damping components of a signal.\n\n\nLet \n\n\n\nf\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(t)}\n\n be a signal consisting of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n evenly spaced samples.

This allows more direct computation of terms.\nwhere:\nProny's method is essentially a decomposition of a signal with \n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n complex exponentials via the following process:\nRegularly sample \n\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n^\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\hat {f}}(t)}\n\n so that the \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-th of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n samples may be written as\nIf \n\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n^\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\hat {f}}(t)}\n\n happens to consist of damped sinusoids, then there will be pairs of complex exponentials such that\nwhere\nBecause the summation of complex exponentials is the homogeneous solution to a linear difference equation, the following difference equation will exist:\nThe key to Prony's Method is that the coefficients in the difference equation are related to the following polynomial:\nThese facts lead to the following three steps to Prony's Method:\n1) Construct and solve the matrix equation for the \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{m}}\n\n values:\nNote that if \n\n\n\nN\n\u2260\n2\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N\\neq 2M}\n\n, a generalized matrix inverse may be needed to find the values \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{m}}\n\n.\n2) After finding the \n\n\n\n\nP\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{m}}\n\n values find the roots (numerically if necessary) of the polynomial\nThe \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n-th root of this polynomial will be equal to \n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\u03bb\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e^{\\lambda _{m}}}\n\n.\n3) With the \n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\u03bb\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e^{\\lambda _{m}}}\n\n values the \n\n\n\n\nF\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F_{n}}\n\n values are part of a system of linear equations that may be used to solve for the \n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {B} _{m}}\n\n values:\nwhere \n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n unique values \n\n\n\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{i}}\n\n are used.
