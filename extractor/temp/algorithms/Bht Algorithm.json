If there is a collision among these inputs, then we return the colliding pair of inputs. Otherwise, all these inputs map to distinct values by f. Then Grover's algorithm is used to find a new input to f that collides. Since there are only n2/3 such inputs to f, Grover's algorithm can find one (if it exists) by making only \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\n\n\nn\n\n2\n\n/\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n)\n=\nO\n(\n\nn\n\n1\n\n/\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O({\\sqrt {n^{2/3}}})=O(n^{1/3})}\n\n queries to f.",
