A common example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal).\nA sample is a value or set of values at a point in time and/or space.\nA sampler is a subsystem or operation that extracts samples from a continuous signal.\nA theoretical ideal sampler produces samples equivalent to the instantaneous value of the continuous signal at the desired points.\n\n\nSampling can be done for functions varying in space, time, or any other dimension, and similar results are obtained in two or more dimensions.\nFor functions that vary with time, let s(t) be a continuous function (or \"signal\") to be sampled, and let sampling be performed by measuring the value of the continuous function every T seconds, which is called the sampling interval or the sampling period.[1]\u00a0 Then the sampled function is given by the sequence:\nThe sampling frequency or sampling rate, fs, is the average number of samples obtained in one second (samples per second), thus fs = 1/T.\nReconstructing a continuous function from samples is done by interpolation algorithms. The Whittaker\u2013Shannon interpolation formula is mathematically equivalent to an ideal lowpass filter whose input is a sequence of Dirac delta functions that are modulated (multiplied) by the sample values. When the time interval between adjacent samples is a constant (T), the sequence of delta functions is called a Dirac comb. Mathematically, the modulated Dirac comb is equivalent to the product of the comb function with s(t). That purely mathematical abstraction is sometimes referred to as impulse sampling.[2]\nMost sampled signals are not simply stored and reconstructed. But the fidelity of a theoretical reconstruction is a customary measure of the effectiveness of sampling. That fidelity is reduced when s(t) contains frequency components whose periodicity is smaller than 2 samples; or equivalently the ratio of cycles to samples exceeds \u00bd (see Aliasing). The quantity \u00bd\u00a0cycles/sample\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0fs\u00a0samples/sec = fs/2 cycles/sec (hertz) is known as the Nyquist frequency of the sampler. Therefore, s(t) is usually the output of a lowpass filter, functionally known as an anti-aliasing filter. Without an anti-aliasing filter, frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency will influence the samples in a way that is misinterpreted by the interpolation process.[3]\nIn practice, the continuous signal is sampled using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a device with various physical limitations. This results in deviations from the theoretically perfect reconstruction, collectively referred to as distortion.\nVarious types of distortion can occur, including:\nAlthough the use of oversampling can completely eliminate aperture error and aliasing by shifting them out of the pass band, this technique cannot be practically used above a few GHz, and may be prohibitively expensive at much lower frequencies. Furthermore, while oversampling can reduce quantization error and non-linearity, it cannot eliminate these entirely. Consequently, practical ADCs at audio frequencies typically do not exhibit aliasing, aperture error, and are not limited by quantization error. Instead, analog noise dominates. At RF and microwave frequencies where oversampling is impractical and filters are expensive, aperture error, quantization error and aliasing can be significant limitations.\nJitter, noise, and quantization are often analyzed by modeling them as random errors added to the sample values. Integration and zero-order hold effects can be analyzed as a form of low-pass filtering. The non-linearities of either ADC or DAC are analyzed by replacing the ideal linear function mapping with a proposed nonlinear function.\nDigital audio uses pulse-code modulation and digital signals for sound reproduction. This includes analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), storage, and transmission. In effect, the system commonly referred to as digital is in fact a discrete-time, discrete-level analog of a previous electrical analog. While modern systems can be quite subtle in their methods, the primary usefulness of a digital system is the ability to store, retrieve and transmit signals without any loss of quality.\nA commonly seen measure of sampling is S/s, which stands for \"Samples per second.\" As an example, 1 MS/s is one million samples per second.\nWhen it is necessary to capture audio covering the entire 20\u201320,000\u00a0Hz range of human hearing,[4]\u00a0 such as when recording music or many types of acoustic events, audio waveforms are typically sampled at 44.1\u00a0kHz (CD), 48\u00a0kHz, 88.2\u00a0kHz, or 96\u00a0kHz.[5]\u00a0 The approximately double-rate requirement is a consequence of the Nyquist theorem. Sampling rates higher than about 50\u00a0kHz to 60\u00a0kHz cannot supply more usable information for human listeners. Early professional audio equipment manufacturers chose sampling rates in the region of 50\u00a0kHz for this reason.\nThere has been an industry trend towards sampling rates well beyond the basic requirements: such as 96\u00a0kHz and even 192\u00a0kHz[6]\u00a0 This is in contrast with laboratory experiments, which have failed to show that ultrasonic frequencies are audible to human observers; however in some cases ultrasonic sounds do interact with and modulate the audible part of the frequency spectrum (intermodulation distortion).[7]\u00a0 It is noteworthy that intermodulation distortion is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound.[8]\u00a0 One advantage of higher sampling rates is that they can relax the low-pass filter design requirements for ADCs and DACs, but with modern oversampling sigma-delta converters this advantage is less important.\nThe Audio Engineering Society recommends 48\u00a0kHz sampling rate for most applications but gives recognition to 44.1\u00a0kHz for Compact Disc and other consumer uses, 32\u00a0kHz for transmission-related applications, and 96\u00a0kHz for higher bandwidth or relaxed anti-aliasing filtering.[9]\nA more complete list of common audio sample rates is:\nAudio is typically recorded at 8-, 16-, and 24-bit depth, which yield a theoretical maximum Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) for a pure sine wave of, approximately, 49.93\u00a0dB, 98.09\u00a0dB and 122.17\u00a0dB.[13] CD quality audio uses 16-bit samples. Thermal noise limits the true number of bits that can be used in quantization. Few analog systems have signal to noise ratios (SNR) exceeding 120\u00a0dB. However, digital signal processing operations can have very high dynamic range, consequently it is common to perform mixing and mastering operations at 32-bit precision and then convert to 16 or 24 bit for distribution.\nSpeech signals, i.e., signals intended to carry only human speech, can usually be sampled at a much lower rate. For most phonemes, almost all of the energy is contained in the 100\u00a0Hz\u20134\u00a0kHz range, allowing a sampling rate of 8\u00a0kHz. This is the sampling rate used by nearly all telephony systems, which use the G.711 sampling and quantization specifications.\nStandard-definition television (SDTV) uses either 720 by 480 pixels (US NTSC 525-line) or 704 by 576 pixels (UK PAL 625-line) for the visible picture area.\nHigh-definition television (HDTV) uses 720p (progressive), 1080i (interlaced), and 1080p (progressive, also known as Full-HD).\nIn digital video, the temporal sampling rate is defined the frame rate \u2013 or rather the field rate \u2013 rather than the notional pixel clock. The image sampling frequency is the repetition rate of the sensor integration period. Since the integration period may be significantly shorter than the time between repetitions, the sampling frequency can be different from the inverse of the sample time:\nVideo digital-to-analog converters operate in the megahertz range (from ~3\u00a0MHz for low quality composite video scalers in early games consoles, to 250\u00a0MHz or more for the highest-resolution VGA output).\nWhen analog video is converted to digital video, a different sampling process occurs, this time at the pixel frequency, corresponding to a spatial sampling rate along scan lines. A common pixel sampling rate is:\nSpatial sampling in the other direction is determined by the spacing of scan lines in the raster. The sampling rates and resolutions in both spatial directions can be measured in units of lines per picture height.\nSpatial aliasing of high-frequency luma or chroma video components shows up as a moir\u00e9 pattern.\nThe process of volume rendering samples a 3D grid of voxels to produce 3D renderings of sliced (tomographic) data. The 3D grid is assumed to represent a continuous region of 3D space. Volume rendering is common in medial imaging, X-ray computed tomography (CT/CAT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are some examples. It is also used for Seismic tomography and other applications.\nWhen a bandpass signal is sampled slower than its Nyquist rate, the samples are indistinguishable from samples of a low-frequency alias of the high-frequency signal. That is often done purposefully in such a way that the lowest-frequency alias satisfies the Nyquist criterion, because the bandpass signal is still uniquely represented and recoverable. Such undersampling is also known as bandpass sampling, harmonic sampling, IF sampling, and direct IF to digital conversion.[14]\nOversampling is used in most modern analog-to-digital converters to reduce the distortion introduced by practical digital-to-analog converters, such as a zero-order hold instead of idealizations like the Whittaker\u2013Shannon interpolation formula.[15]\nComplex sampling (I/Q sampling) is the simultaneous sampling of two different, but related, waveforms, resulting in pairs of samples that are subsequently treated as complex numbers.[note 1]\u00a0 When one waveform\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\ns\n^\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ,{\\hat {s}}(t),}\n\n\u00a0 is the Hilbert transform of the other waveform\n\n\n\n,\ns\n(\nt\n)\n,\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ,s(t),\\,}\n\n\u00a0 the complex-valued function, \u00a0\n\n\n\n\ns\n\na\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\ndef\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\ns\n(\nt\n)\n+\nj\n\u22c5\n\n\n\ns\n^\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s_{a}(t)\\ {\\stackrel {\\text{def}}{=}}\\ s(t)+j\\cdot {\\hat {s}}(t),}\n\n\u00a0 is called an analytic signal,\u00a0 whose Fourier transform is zero for all negative values of frequency. In that case, the Nyquist rate for a waveform with no frequencies \u2265\u00a0B can be reduced to just B (complex samples/sec), instead of 2B (real samples/sec).[note 2] More apparently, the equivalent baseband waveform, \u00a0\n\n\n\n\ns\n\na\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u22c5\n\ne\n\n\u2212\nj\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\nB\n2\n\n\nt\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s_{a}(t)\\cdot e^{-j2\\pi {\\frac {B}{2}}t},}\n\n\u00a0 also has a Nyquist rate of B, because all of its non-zero frequency content is shifted into the interval [-B/2, B/2).\nAlthough complex-valued samples can be obtained as described above, they are also created by manipulating samples of a real-valued waveform. For instance, the equivalent baseband waveform can be created without explicitly computing \n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n^\n\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\hat {s}}(t),}\n\n\u00a0 by processing the product sequence\n\n\n\n,\n\n[\ns\n(\nn\nT\n)\n\u22c5\n\ne\n\n\u2212\nj\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\nB\n2\n\n\nT\nn\n\n\n]\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ,\\left[s(nT)\\cdot e^{-j2\\pi {\\frac {B}{2}}Tn}\\right],}\n\n[note 3] \u00a0through a digital lowpass filter whose cutoff frequency is B/2.[note 4] Computing only every other sample of the output sequence reduces the sample-rate commensurate with the reduced Nyquist rate. The result is half as many complex-valued samples as the original number of real samples. No information is lost, and the original s(t) waveform can be recovered, if necessary.",
