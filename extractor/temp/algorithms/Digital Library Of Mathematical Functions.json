    "about": "The Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) is an online project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a major resource of mathematical reference data for special functions and their applications. It is intended as an update of Abramowitz's and Stegun's Handbook of Mathematical Functions (A&S).[1] It was published online on May 7, 2010, though some chapters appeared earlier. In the same year it appeared at Cambridge University Press under the title NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions.[2]",
