In the latter case the HOSIDFs require little model assumptions and can easily be identified while requiring no advanced mathematical tools. Moreover, even when a model is already identified, the analysis of the HOSIDFs often yields significant advantages over the use of the identified nonlinear model. First of all, the HOSIDFs are intuitive in their identification and interpretation while other nonlinear model structures often yield limited direct information about the behavior of the system in practice. Furthermore, the HOSIDFs provide a natural extension of the widely used sinusoidal describing functions in case nonlinearities cannot be neglected. In practice the HOSIDFs have two distinct applications: Due to their ease of identification, HOSIDFs provide a tool to provide on-site testing during system design. Finally, the application of HOSIDFs to (nonlinear) controller design for nonlinear systems is shown to yield significant advantages over conventional time domain based tuning.",
