To discretize this equation by the finite element method, one chooses a set of basis functions {\u03c61, ..., \u03c6n} defined on \u03a9 which also vanish on the boundary. One then approximates\nThe coefficients u1, ..., un are determined so that the error in the approximation is orthogonal to each basis function \u03c6i:\nThe stiffness matrix is the n-element square matrix A defined by\nBy defining the vector F with components Fi = (\u03c6i,\u00a0f), the coefficients ui are determined by the linear system AU = F. The stiffness matrix is symmetric, i.e. Aij = Aji, so all its eigenvalues are real. Moreover, it is a strictly positive-definite matrix, so that the system AU = F always has a unique solution. (For other problems, these nice properties will be lost.)\nNote that the stiffness matrix will be different depending on the computational grid used for the domain and what type of finite element is used. For example, the stiffness matrix when piecewise quadratic finite elements are used will have more degrees of freedom than piecewise linear elements.\nDetermining the stiffness matrix for other PDE follows essentially the same procedure, but it can be complicated by the choice of boundary conditions. As a more complex example, consider the elliptic equation\nwhere A(x) = akl(x) is a positive-definite matrix defined for each point x in the domain. We impose the Robin boundary condition\nwhere \u03bdk is the component of the unit outward normal vector \u03bd in the k-th direction. The system to be solved is\nas can be shown using an analogue of Green's identity. The coefficients ui are still found by solving a system of linear equations, but the matrix representing the system is markedly different from that for the ordinary Poisson problem.\nIn general, to each scalar elliptic operator L of order 2k, there is associated a bilinear form B on the Sobolev space Hk, so that the weak formulation of the equation Lu = f is\nfor all functions v in Hk. Then the stiffness matrix for this problem is\nIn order to implement the finite element method on a computer, one must first choose a set of basis functions and then compute the integrals defining the stiffness matrix. Usually, the domain \u03a9 is discretized by some form of mesh generation, wherein it is divided into non-overlapping triangles or quadrilaterals, which are generally referred to as elements. The basis functions are then chosen to be polynomials of some order within each element, and continuous across element boundaries. The simplest choices are piecewise linear for triangular elements and piecewise bilinear for rectangular elements.\nThe element stiffness matrix A[k] for element Tk is the matrix\nThe element stiffness matrix is zero for most values of i and j, for which the corresponding basis functions are zero within Tk. The full stiffness matrix A is the sum of the element stiffness matrices. In particular, for basis functions that are only supported locally, the stiffness matrix is sparse.\nFor many standard choices of basis functions, i.e. piecewise linear basis functions on triangles, there are simple formulas for the element stiffness matrices. For example, for piecewise linear elements, consider a triangle with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), and define the 2\u00d73 matrix\nThen the element stiffness matrix is\nWhen the differential equation is more complicated, say by having an inhomogeneous diffusion coefficient, the integral defining the element stiffness matrix can be evaluated by Gaussian quadrature.\nThe condition number of the stiffness matrix depends strongly on the quality of the numerical grid. In particular, triangles with small angles in the finite element mesh induce large eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix, degrading the solution quality.",
