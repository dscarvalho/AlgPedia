    "about": "In econometrics and signal processing, a stochastic process is said to be ergodic if its statistical properties can be deduced from a single, sufficiently long, random sample of the process. The reasoning is that any collection of random samples from a process must represent the average statistical properties of the entire process. In other words, regardless of what the individual samples are, a birds-eye view of the collection of samples must represent the whole process. Conversely, a process that is not ergodic is a process that changes erratically at an inconsistent rate.[1]",

In other words, regardless of what the individual samples are, a birds-eye view of the collection of samples must represent the whole process. Conversely, a process that is not ergodic is a process that changes erratically at an inconsistent rate.[1]\n\n\nOne can discuss the ergodicity of various statistics of a stochastic process. For example, a wide-sense stationary process \n\n\n\nX\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X(t)}\n\n has constant mean\nand autocovariance\nthat depends only on the lag \n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\n and not on time \n\n\n\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t}\n\n. The properties \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{X}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nr\n\nX\n\n\n(\n\u03c4\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{X}(\\tau )}\n\n are ensemble averages not time averages.\nThe process \n\n\n\nX\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X(t)}\n\n is said to be mean-ergodic[2] or mean-square ergodic in the first moment[3] if the time average estimate\nconverges in squared mean to the ensemble average \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{X}}\n\n as \n\n\n\nT\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T\\rightarrow \\infty }\n\n.\nLikewise, the process is said to be autocovariance-ergodic or mean-square ergodic in the second moment[3] if the time average estimate\nconverges in squared mean to the ensemble average \n\n\n\n\nr\n\nX\n\n\n(\n\u03c4\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{X}(\\tau )}\n\n, as \n\n\n\nT\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T\\rightarrow \\infty }\n\n. A process which is ergodic in the mean and autocovariance is sometimes called ergodic in the wide sense.[3]\nAn important example of an ergodic processes is the stationary Gaussian process with continuous spectrum.\nThe notion of ergodicity also applies to discrete-time random processes \n\n\n\nX\n[\nn\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X[n]}\n\n for integer \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n.\nA discrete-time random process \n\n\n\nX\n[\nn\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X[n]}\n\n is ergodic in mean if\nconverges in squared mean to the ensemble average \n\n\n\nE\n[\nX\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E[X]}\n\n, as \n\n\n\nN\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N\\rightarrow \\infty }\n\n.\nSuppose that we have two coins: one coin is fair and the other has two heads. We choose (at random) one of the coins, and then perform a sequence of independent tosses of our selected coin. Let X[n] denote the outcome of the nth toss, with 1 for heads and 0 for tails. Then the ensemble average is \u00bd\u2009\u2009(\u00bd + \u20091) = \u00be; yet the long-term average is \u00bd for the fair coin and 1 for the two-headed coin. Hence, this random process is not ergodic in mean.",
