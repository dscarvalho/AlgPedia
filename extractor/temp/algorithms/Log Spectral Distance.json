Unlike the Itakura\u2013Saito distance, the log-spectral distance is symmetric.\nIn speech coding log spectral distortion for a given frame is defined as the root mean square difference between the original LPC log power spectrum and the quantize or interpolated LPC log power spectrum. Usually the average of spectral distortion over a large number of frames is calculated. and that is used as the measure of performance of quantization or interpolation.",
