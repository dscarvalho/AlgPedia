    "full_text": "In numerical analysis, Halley\u2019s method is a root-finding algorithm used for functions of one real variable with a continuous second derivative, i.e., C2 functions. It is named after its inventor Edmond Halley.\nThe algorithm is second in the class of Householder's methods, right after Newton's method. Like the latter, it produces iteratively a sequence of approximations to the root; their rate of convergence to the root is cubic. Multidimensional versions of this method exist.\nHalley's method can be viewed as exactly finding the roots of a linear-over-linear Pad\u00e9 approximation to the function, in contrast to Newton's method/Secant method (approximates/interpolates the function linearly) or Cauchy's method/Muller's method (approximates/interpolates the function quadratically).[1]\n\n\nHalley\u2019s method is a numerical algorithm for solving the nonlinear equation f(x) = 0. In this case, the function f has to be a function of one real variable. The method consists of a sequence of iterations:\nbeginning with an initial guess x0.\nIf f is a three times continuously differentiable function and a is a zero of f but not of its derivative, then, in a neighborhood of a, the iterates xn satisfy:\nThis means that the iterates converge to the zero if the initial guess is sufficiently close, and that the convergence is cubic.\nThe following alternative formulation shows the similarity between Halley\u2019s method and Newton\u2019s method. The expression \n\n\n\nf\n(\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n/\n\n\nf\n\u2032\n\n(\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x_{n})/f'(x_{n})}\n\n is computed only once, and it is particularly useful when \n\n\n\n\nf\n\u2033\n\n(\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n/\n\n\nf\n\u2032\n\n(\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f''(x_{n})/f'(x_{n})}\n\n can be simplified.\nA further alternative is as below, in which case the technique is sometimes referred to as Bailey\u2019s method.[2]\nUsing any variation, when the second derivative is very close to zero, the iteration is almost the same as under Newton\u2019s method.\nConsider the function\nAny root of f which is not a root of its derivative is a root of g; and any root r of g must be a root of f provided the derivative of f at r is not infinite. Applying Newton's method to g gives\nwith\nand the result follows. Notice that if f\u2032(c) = 0, then one cannot apply this at c because g(c) would be undefined.\nSuppose a is a root of f but not of its derivative. And suppose that the third derivative of f exists and is continuous in a neighborhood of a and xn is in that neighborhood. Then Taylor's theorem implies:\nand also\nwhere \u03be and \u03b7 are numbers lying between a and xn.
