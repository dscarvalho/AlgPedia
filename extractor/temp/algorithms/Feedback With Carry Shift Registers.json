By iterating the state change an FCSR generates an infinite, eventually period sequence of numbers in \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n.\nFCSRs have been used in the design of stream ciphers (such as the F-FCSR generator), in the cryptanalyis of the summation combiner stream cipher (the reason Goresky and Klapper invented them[1]), and in generating pseudorandom numbers for quasi-Monte Carlo (under the name Multiply With Carry (MWC) generator - invented by Couture and L'Ecuyer,[2]) generalizing work of Marsaglia and Zaman.[5]\nFCSRs are analyzed using number theory. Associated with the FCSR is a connection integer \n\n\n\nq\n=\n\nq\n\nr\n\n\n\nN\n\nr\n\n\n+\n\u22ef\n+\n\nq\n\n1\n\n\n\nN\n\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q=q_{r}N^{r}+\\dots +q_{1}N^{1}-1}\n\n. Associated with the output sequence is the N-adic number \n\n\n\na\n=\n\na\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\na\n\n1\n\n\nN\n+\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\nN\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\u2026\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a=a_{0}+a_{1}N+a_{2}N^{2}+\\dots }\n\n The fundamental theorem of FCSRs says that there is an integer \n\n\n\nu\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u}\n\n so that \n\n\n\na\n=\nu\n\n/\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a=u/q}\n\n, a rational number. The output sequence is strictly periodic if and only if \n\n\n\nu\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u}\n\n is between \n\n\n\n\u2212\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -q}\n\n and \n\n\n\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0}\n\n. It is possible to express u as a simple quadratic polynomial involving the initial state and the qi.[1]\nThere is also an exponential representation of FCSRs: if \n\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g}\n\n is the inverse of \n\n\n\nN\n\nmod\n\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N\\mod q}\n\n, and the output sequence is strictly periodic, then \n\n\n\n\na\n\ni\n\n\n=\n(\nA\n\ng\n\ni\n\n\n\nmod\n\n\nq\n)\n\nmod\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{i}=(Ag_{i}\\mod q)\\mod N}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n is an integer. It follows that the period is at most the order of N in the multiplicative group of units modulo q. This is maximized when q is prime and N is a primitive element modulo q. In this case, the period is \n\n\n\nq\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q-1}\n\n. In this case the output sequence is called an l-sequence (for \"long sequence\").[1]\nl-sequences have many excellent statistical properties[1][3] that make them candidates for use in applications,[6] including near uniform distribution of sub-blocks, ideal arithmetic autocorrelations, and the arithmetic shift and add property. They are the with-carry analog of m-sequences or maximum length sequences.\nThere are efficient algorithms for FCSR synthesis. This is the problem: given a prefix of a sequence, construct a minimal length FCSR that outputs the sequence. This can be solved with a variant of Mahler[7] and De Weger's[8] lattice based analysis of N-adic numbers when \n\n\n\nN\n=\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N=2}\n\n;[1] by a variant of the Euclidean algorithm when N is prime; and in general by Xu's adaptation of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.[9] If L is the size of the smallest FCSR that outputs the sequence (called the N-adic complexity of the sequence), then all these algorithms require a prefix of length about \n\n\n\n2\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2L}\n\n to be successful and have quadratic time complexity. It follows that, as with LFSRs and linear complexity, any stream cipher whose N-adic complexity is low should not be used for cryptography.\nFCSRs and LFSRs are special cases of a very general algebraic construction of sequence generators called Algebraic Feedback Shift Registers (AFSRs) in which the integers are replaced by an arbitrary ring R and N is replaced by an arbitrary non-unit in R.[10] A general reference on the subject of LFSRs, FCSRs, and AFSRs is the book.[4]",
