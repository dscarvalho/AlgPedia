The problem can be formally defined as follows:\nFor a metric space (\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {X}}}\n\n,d),\nThat is, Every point in a cluster is in distance at most \n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n(\nV\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r^{\\mathcal {C}}(V)}\n\n from its respective center. [1]\nThe k-Center Clustering problem can also be defined on a complete undirected graph G\u00a0=\u00a0(V,\u00a0E) as follows:\nGiven a complete undirected graph G\u00a0=\u00a0(V,\u00a0E) with distances d(vi,\u00a0vj)\u00a0\u2208\u00a0N satisfying the triangle inequality, find a subset C\u00a0\u2286\u00a0V with |C|\u00a0=\u00a0k while minimizing:\nIn a complete undirected graph G\u00a0=\u00a0(V,\u00a0E), if we sort the edges in nondecreasing order of the distances: d(e1)\u00a0\u2264\u00a0d(e2)\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u2264\u00a0d(em) and let Gi\u00a0=\u00a0(Vi,\u00a0Ei), where Ei\u00a0=\u00a0{e1,\u00a0e2,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0ei}. The k-center problem is equivalent to finding the smallest index i such that Gi has a dominating set of size at most k. [2]\nAlthough Dominating Set is NP-complete, the k-center problem remains NP-hard. This is clear, since the optimality of a given feasible solution for the k-center problem can be determined through the Dominating Set reduction only if we know in first place the size of the optimal solution (i.e. the smallest index i such that Gi has a dominating set of size at most k) , which is precisely the difficult core of the NP-Hard problems.\nA simple greedy approximation algorithm that achieves an approximation factor of 2 builds \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}}\n\n using a farthest-first traversal in k iterations. This algorithm simply chooses the point farthest away from the current set of centers in each iteration as the new center. It can be described as follows:\nThe solution obtained using the simple greedy algorithm is a 2-approximation to the optimal solution. This section focuses on proving this approximation factor.\nGiven a set of n points \n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\u2286\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {V} \\subseteq {\\mathcal {X}}}\n\n,belonging to a metric space (\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {X}}}\n\n,d), the greedy K-center algorithm computes a set K of k centers, such that K is a 2-approximation to the optimal k-center clustering of V.\ni.e. \n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n(\n\nV\n\n)\n\u2264\n2\n\nr\n\no\np\nt\n\n\n(\n\nV\n\n,\n\n\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r^{\\mathbf {K} }(\\mathbf {V} )\\leq 2r^{opt}(\\mathbf {V} ,{\\textit {k}})}\n\n [1]\nThis theorem can be proven using two cases as follows,\nCase 1: Every cluster of \n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\no\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}_{opt}}\n\n contains exactly one point of \n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {K} }\n\n\n\nCase 2: There are two centers \n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {k}}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {u}}}\n\n of \n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {K} }\n\n that are both in \n\n\n\n\u03a0\n(\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\no\np\nt\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Pi ({\\mathcal {C}}_{opt},{\\bar {c}})}\n\n, for some \n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\no\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {c}}\\in {\\mathcal {C}}_{opt}}\n\n (By pigeon hole principle, this is the only other possibility)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n(\n\nV\n\n)\n\u2264\n\nr\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nV\n\n)\n\n\n\n=\nd\n(\n\n\n\nu\n\u00af\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2264\nd\n(\n\n\n\nu\n\u00af\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nk\n\u00af\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2264\nd\n(\n\n\n\nu\n\u00af\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\n\n)\n+\nd\n(\n\n\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nk\n\u00af\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2264\n2\n\nr\n\no\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}r^{\\mathbf {K} }(\\mathbf {V} )\\leq r^{{\\mathcal {C}}_{i-1}}(\\mathbf {V} )&=d({\\bar {u}},{\\mathcal {C}}_{i-1})\\\\&\\leq d({\\bar {u}},{\\bar {k}})\\\\&\\leq d({\\bar {u}},{\\bar {c}})+d({\\bar {c}},{\\bar {k}})\\\\&\\leq 2r^{opt}\\end{aligned}}}\n\n [1]\nAnother algorithm with the same approximation factor takes advantage of the fact that the k-center problem is equivalent to finding the smallest index i such that Gi has a dominating set of size at most k and computes a maximal independent set of Gi, looking for the smallest index i that has a maximal independent set with a size of at least k. [4] It is not possible to find an approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of 2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b5 for any \u03b5\u00a0>\u00a00, unless P = NP. [5] Furthermore, the distances of all edges in G must satisfy the triangle inequality if the k-center problem is to be approximated within any constant factor, unless P = NP. [6]",
