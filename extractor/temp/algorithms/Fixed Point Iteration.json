    "full_text": "In numerical analysis, fixed-point iteration is a method of computing fixed points of iterated functions.\nMore specifically, given a function \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n defined on the real numbers with real values and given a point \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{0}}\n\n in the domain of \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n, the fixed point iteration is\nwhich gives rise to the sequence \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\\dots }\n\n which is hoped to converge to a point \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n.
