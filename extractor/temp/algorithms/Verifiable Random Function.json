Later, an efficient and practical verifiable random function was proposed by Yevgeniy Dodis and Aleksandr Yampolskiy.[2] In their construction,\nwhere e(\u00b7,\u00b7) is a bilinear map. To verify whether \n\n\n\n\nF\n\nS\nK\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F_{SK}(x)}\n\n was computed correctly or not, one can check if \n\n\n\ne\n(\n\ng\n\nx\n\n\nP\nK\n,\n\np\n\nS\nK\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n)\n=\ne\n(\ng\n,\ng\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e(g^{x}PK,p_{SK}(x))=e(g,g)}\n\n.\nThe proof of security relies on a new decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion assumption, which asks given \n\n\n\n(\ng\n,\n\ng\n\nx\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\ng\n\n(\n\nx\n\nq\n\n\n)\n\n\n,\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (g,g^{x},\\ldots ,g^{(x^{q})},R)}\n\n as input to distinguish \n\n\n\nR\n=\ne\n(\ng\n,\ng\n\n)\n\n1\n\n/\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R=e(g,g)^{1/x}}\n\n from random.\n",
