Adaptive filters find applications in areas such as Noise cancellation, Signal prediction, Equalization and Echo cancellation. Examples of applications of 2D adaptive filters include Image Denoising,[1] Motion Tracking,[2] OFDM channel estimation,[3] magnetic recording equalization [4]\n2D Adaptive Filters can be used to identify systems.

The 2D LMS Adaptive filters are derived from the 1D LMS adaptvie filters main method which minimizes the output mean square value by adjusting coefficients of the filter. The filter has the primary 2D input signal d and the reference input signal x. The primary input signal d consists of the ideal signal and noise component.

The algorithm convergence does not depend on the initial conditions and it will converge for any arbitrarily initial value, hence, it provides good performance in nonstationary images.\nDisadvantages: The exact values of the expectations of the TDLMS adaptive filter will not converges to a fixed value, if we need to maintain its tracking ability. Therefore, the design choice of \u03bc depends on the particular application and it involves a tradeoff between the convergence speed, tracking ability, and steady-state MSE.\nFor a two-dimensional LMS IIR Adaptive filter, its basic idea is the same as 2D LMS FIR Adaptive Filters, except we are using an IIR filter, which can reduce the filter order requirements.[6] The two-dimensional IIR filter`s difference equation can be written as\n\n\n\n\ny\n(\n\nn\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u2211\n\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\nM\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\nM\n\n2\n\n\n\n\na\n(\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n)\nx\n(\n\nn\n\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\u2260\n(\n0\n,\n0\n)\n\n\nb\n(\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n)\ny\n(\n\nn\n\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y(n_{1},n_{2})=\\sum _{m_{1}=0}^{M_{1}}\\sum _{m_{2}=0}^{M_{2}}a(m_{1},m_{2})x(n_{1}-m_{1},n_{2}-m_{2})-{\\sum _{m_{1}=0}^{L_{1}}\\sum _{m_{2}=0}^{L_{2}}}_{(m_{1},m_{2})\\neq (0,0)}b(m_{1},m_{2})y(n_{1}-m_{1},n_{2}-m_{2})}\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\ny\n(\n\nn\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y(n_{1},n_{2})}\n\n and \n\n\n\nx\n(\n\nn\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x(n_{1},n_{2})}\n\n are, respectively, the output and input of the adaptive filter. \n\n\n\nb\n(\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b(m_{1},m_{2})}\n\n and \n\n\n\na\n(\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a(m_{1},m_{2})}\n\n are the masks of the filter`s input and output.

Meanwhile, adaptive IIR filters may become unstable during the adaptation, thus some kind of stability monitoring is needed.\n2D Recursive Least Square Adaptive Filters [7] can be developed by applying 1D Recursive Least Squares filters along both horizontal and vertical directions. The RLS adaptive is an algorithm which finds the filter coefficients recursively to minimize the weighted least squares cost function. The RLS algorithm is different to the least mean suquares algorithm which aim to reduce the mean square error, its input signal is considered deterministic. For this reason, the RLS algorithm has fast convergence characteristic.\nAdvantages:The RLS algorithm has fast convergence property. The accuracy of image denoising based on RLS algorithm is better than 2D LMS adaptive filters.\nDisadvantages:The RLS algorithm needs a large amount of computations, especially in Two-demensional and Multi-dimensional case.\nOne convenient approach to implement 2D Adaptive Filters is to transform the 2D problem into a 1D problem by lexicographic ordering.[5] This simplifies the implementation and makes it possible to benefit from the extensive literature that is available for 1D adaptive filters and utilize all of the existing 1D algorithms.\nMcClellan transformations [8] can be used to transform a 1D filter design into a 2D filter design by using a transformation function. This theory allows the design of 2D adaptive filters [9] out of existing 1D prototype filters. Compared to the direct approach, this system has the advantages of a lower computational complexity and a faster convergence rate. However, in order to work properly, it needs some a priori information about the system to correctly select the transformation function parameters, making the system pre-constrained.\nBlock Diagonal 2D Adaptive Filters is an alternative approach [10] that scans the signal through blocks and applies weight adjustments for each block, instead of for each sample as in the traditional adaptive filters. The advantage of this kind of system is that it takes into account signal correlations along both dimensions. On the other hand, it assumes a higher local stationarity of the signal.",
