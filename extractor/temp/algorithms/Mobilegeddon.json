The main effect of this update is to give priority to web sites that display well on smartphones and other mobile devices. The change does not affect searches made from a desktop computer or a laptop.[1]\nGoogle announced its intention to make the change in February 2015.[2] The Economist found the timing \"awkward\" because they said \"It comes less than a week after the European Union accused the firm...\" of anti-competitive behaviors.[3] In addition to their announcement, Google published an article on their Google Developers page to help webmasters with the transition titled \"Mobile Friendly Sites\".[4] Google claims the transition to mobile-friendly sites was to improve user-experience, stating \"the desktop version of a site might be difficult to view and use on a mobile device.\"[4]\nThe protologism is a blend word of \"mobile\" and \"Armageddon\" because the change \"could cause massive disruption to page rankings.\"[5] But, writing for Forbes, Robert Hof says that concerns about the change were \"overblown\" in part because \"Google is providing a test to see if sites look good on smartphones\".[6]\nSearch engine results pages on smartphones now show URLs in \"breadcrumb\" format, as opposed to the previous explicit format.[7]\nBased on their data set, software company Searchmetrics found that the average loss of rankings for the non-mobile friendly sites measured was 0.21 positions on average.[8] Content marketing company BrightEdge has tracked over 20,000 URLs since the update, and is reporting a 21% decrease in non mobile-friendly URLs on the first 3 pages of search results.[9] According to Peter J. Meyers it was \u201cnothing to write home about\u201d.[10]",
