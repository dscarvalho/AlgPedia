SINADR is defined as:\nwhere \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n is the average power of the signal, quantization error, random noise and distortion components. SINADR is usually expressed in dB. SINADR is a standard metric for analog-to-digital converter and digital-to-analog converter.\nSINADR (in dB) is related to ENOB by the following equation:\n",
