    "full_text": "TOLMIN [1][2] is a numerical optimization algorithm by Michael J. D. Powell. It is also the name of Powell's Fortran 77 implementation of the algorithm.\nTOLMIN seeks the minimum of a differentiable nonlinear function subject to linear constraints (equality and/or inequality) and simple bounds on variables. Each search direction is calculated so that it does not intersect the boundary of any inequality constraint that is satisfied and that has a \"small\" residual at the beginning of the line search. The meaning of \"small\" depends on a parameter called TOL which is automatically adjusted, and which gives the name of the software.\nFeatures of the software include: quadratic approximations of the objective function whose second derivative matrices are updated by means of the BFGS formula, active sets technique, primal-dual quadratic programming procedure for calculation of the search direction.\nThe TOLMIN software is distributed under The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).[2]",
