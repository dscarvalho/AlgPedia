Model order reduction aims to lower the computational complexity of such problems, for example, in simulations of large-scale dynamical systems and control systems. By a reduction of the model's associated state space dimension or degrees of freedom, an approximation to the original model is computed. This reduced-order model (ROM) can then be evaluated with lower accuracy but in significantly less time.\nA common approach for model order reduction is projection-based reduction. The following methods fall into this class:",
