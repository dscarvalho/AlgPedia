    "about": "NeuroMatrix is a digital signal processor (DSP) series developed by NTC Module. The DSP has a VLIW/SIMD architecture. It consists of a 32-bit RISC core and a 64-bit vector co-processor. The vector co-processor supports vector operations with elements of variable bit length (US Pat. 6539368 B1) and is optimized to support the implementation of artificial neural networks.[1] From this derives the name NeuroMatrix Core (NMC). Newer devices contain multiple DSP cores and an additional ARM11 core.",
