It was invented by Austrian mathematician Bruno Buchberger. One can view it as a generalization of the Euclidean algorithm for univariate GCD computation and of Gaussian elimination for linear systems.\n\n\nA crude version of this algorithm to find a basis for an ideal I of a polynomial ring R proceeds as follows:\nThe polynomial Sij is commonly referred to as the S-polynomial, where S refers to subtraction (Buchberger) or Syzygy (others). The pair of polynomials with which it is associated is commonly referred to as critical pair.\nThere are numerous ways to improve this algorithm beyond what has been stated above. For example, one could reduce all the new elements of F relative to each other before adding them. If the leading terms of fi and fj share no variables in common, then Sij will always reduce to 0 (if we use only fi and fj for reduction), so we needn't calculate it at all.\nThe algorithm terminates because it is consistently increasing the size of the monomial ideal generated by the leading terms of our set F, and Dickson's lemma (or the Hilbert basis theorem) guarantees that any such ascending chain must eventually become constant.\nThe computational complexity of Buchberger's algorithm is very difficult to estimate, because of the number of choices that may dramatically change the computation time. Nevertheless, T. W. Dub\u00e9 has proved[1] that the degrees of the elements of a reduced Gr\u00f6bner basis are always bounded by\nwhere n is the number of variables, and d the maximal total degree of the input polynomials. This allows, in theory, to use linear algebra over the vector space of the polynomials of degree bounded by this value, for getting an algorithm of complexity \n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n2\n\nn\n+\no\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d^{2^{n+o(1)}}}\n\n.\nOn the other hand, there are examples[2] where the Gr\u00f6bner basis contains elements of degree\nand above upper bound of complexity is almost optimal, up to a constant factor in the second exponent). Nevertheless, such examples are extremely rare.\nSince its discovery, many variants of Buchberger's have been introduced to improve its efficiency. Faug\u00e8re's F4 and F5 algorithms are presently the most efficient algorithms for computing Gr\u00f6bner bases, and allow to compute routinely Gr\u00f6bner bases consisting of several hundreds of polynomials, having each several hundreds of terms and coefficients of several hundreds of digits.",
