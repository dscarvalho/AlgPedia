    "full_text": "Shor's algorithm, named after mathematician Peter Shor, is a quantum algorithm (an algorithm that runs on a quantum computer) for integer factorization formulated in 1994. Informally it solves the following problem: given an integer N, find its prime factors.\nOn a quantum computer, to factor an integer N, Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time (the time taken is polynomial in log N, which is the size of the input).[1] Specifically it takes quantum gates of order O((log N)2(log log N)(log log log N)) using fast multiplication,[2] demonstrating that the integer factorization problem can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer and is thus in the complexity class BQP. This is substantially faster than the most efficient known classical factoring algorithm, the general number field sieve, which works in sub-exponential time \u2014 about O(e1.9 (log N)1/3 (log log N)2/3).[3] The efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of the quantum Fourier transform, and modular exponentiation by repeated squarings.\nIf a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits could operate without succumbing to noise and other quantum decoherence phenomena, Shor's algorithm could be used to break public-key cryptography schemes such as the widely used RSA scheme. RSA is based on the assumption that factoring large numbers is computationally intractable. So far as is known, this assumption is valid for classical (non-quantum) computers; no classical algorithm is known that can factor in polynomial time. However, Shor's algorithm shows that factoring is efficient on an ideal quantum computer, so it may be feasible to defeat RSA by constructing a large quantum computer. It was also a powerful motivator for the design and construction of quantum computers and for the study of new quantum computer algorithms. It has also facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called post-quantum cryptography.\nIn 2001, Shor's algorithm was demonstrated by a group at IBM, who factored 15 into 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05, using an NMR implementation of a quantum computer with 7 qubits.[4] After IBM's implementation, two independent groups implemented Shor's algorithm using photonic qubits, emphasizing that multi-qubit entanglement was observed when running the Shor's algorithm circuits.[5][6] In 2012, the factorization of 15 was performed with solid-state qubits.[7] Also in 2012, the factorization of 21 was achieved, setting the record for the largest number factored with Shor's algorithm.[8] In April 2012, the factorization of 143 was achieved, although this used adiabatic quantum computation rather than Shor's algorithm.[9] In November 2014, it was discovered that this 2012 adiabatic quantum computation had also factored larger numbers, the largest being 56153.[10][11]\n\n\nThe problem we are trying to solve is: given an odd composite number \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n, find an integer \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n, strictly between \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n and \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n, that divides \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n. We are interested in odd values of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n because any even value of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n trivially has the number \n\n\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2}\n\n as a prime factor. We can use a primality testing algorithm to make sure that \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n is indeed composite.\nMoreover, for the algorithm to work, we need \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n not to be the power of a prime. This can be tested by checking that \n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{k}]{N}}}\n\n is not an integer, for all \n\n\n\nk\n\u2264\n\nlog\n\n2\n\n\n\u2061\n(\nN\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k\\leq \\log _{2}(N)}\n\n.\nSince \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n is not a power of a prime, it is the product of two coprime numbers greater than \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n. As a consequence of the Chinese remainder theorem, the number \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n has at least four distinct square roots modulo \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n, two of them being \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -1}\n\n. The aim of the algorithm is to find a square root \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n of one other factor; such a \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n will lead to a factorization of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n, as in other factoring algorithms like the quadratic sieve.\nIn turn, finding such a \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n is reduced to finding an element \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n of even period with a certain additional property (as explained below, it is required that the condition of Step 6 of the classical part does not hold). The quantum algorithm is used for finding the period of randomly chosen elements \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, as order-finding is a hard problem on a classical computer.\nShor's algorithm consists of two parts:\nFor example: \n\n\n\nN\n=\n15\n,\na\n=\n7\n,\nr\n=\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N=15,a=7,r=4}\n\n, \n\n\n\n\ng\nc\nd\n\n(\n\n7\n\n2\n\n\n\u00b1\n1\n,\n15\n)\n=\n\ng\nc\nd\n\n(\n49\n\u00b1\n1\n,\n15\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {gcd} (7^{2}\\pm 1,15)=\\mathrm {gcd} (49\\pm 1,15)}\n\n, where \n\n\n\n\ng\nc\nd\n\n(\n48\n,\n15\n)\n=\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {gcd} (48,15)=3}\n\n, and \n\n\n\n\ng\nc\nd\n\n(\n50\n,\n15\n)\n=\n5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {gcd} (50,15)=5}\n\n.\nThe quantum circuits used for this algorithm are custom designed for each choice of N and each choice of the random a used in f(x) = ax mod N. Given N, find Q = 2q such that \n\n\n\n\nN\n\n2\n\n\n\u2264\nQ\n<\n2\n\nN\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N^{2}\\leq Q<2N^{2}}\n\n, which implies \n\n\n\nQ\n\n/\n\nr\n>\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q/r>N}\n\n. The input and output qubit registers need to hold superpositions of values from 0 to Q \u2212 1, and so have q qubits each. Using what might appear to be twice as many qubits as necessary guarantees that there are at least N different x which produce the same f(x), even as the period r approaches N/2.\nProceed as follows:\nThis leads to the final state\nNow we reorder this sum as\nThis is a superposition of many more than Q states, but many fewer than Q2 states, since there are fewer than Q distinct values of \n\n\n\nz\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z=f(x)}\n\n.

The first part of the algorithm turns the factoring problem into the problem of finding the period of a function, and may be implemented classically. The second part finds the period using the quantum Fourier transform, and is responsible for the quantum speedup.\nThe integers less than N and coprime with N form a finite abelian group \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n under multiplication modulo N. The size is given by Euler's totient function \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n(\nN\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi (N)}\n\n. By the end of step 3, we have an integer a in this group. Since the group is finite, a must have a finite order r, the smallest positive integer such that\nTherefore, \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n divides \n\n\n\n\na\n\nr\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{r}-1}\n\n (also written \n\n\n\nN\n\u2223\n\na\n\nr\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N\\mid a^{r}-1}\n\n). Suppose we are able to obtain r, and it is even. (If r is odd, see step 5.) Now \n\n\n\nb\n\u2261\n\na\n\nr\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n(\nmod\n\nN\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b\\equiv a^{r/2}{\\pmod {N}}}\n\n is a square root of 1 modulo \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n, different from 1. This is because \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n is the order of \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n modulo \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n, so \n\n\n\n\na\n\nr\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\u2262\n1\n\n\n(\nmod\n\nN\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{r/2}\\not \\equiv 1{\\pmod {N}}}\n\n, else the order of \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n in this group would be \n\n\n\nr\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r/2}\n\n. If \n\n\n\n\na\n\nr\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\u2261\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n(\nmod\n\nN\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{r/2}\\equiv -1{\\pmod {N}}}\n\n, by step 6 we have to restart the algorithm with a different random number \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n.\nEventually, we must hit an \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, of order \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n in \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n, such that \n\n\n\nb\n\u2261\n\na\n\nr\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\u2262\n1\n,\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n(\nmod\n\nN\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b\\equiv a^{r/2}\\not \\equiv 1,-1{\\pmod {N}}}\n\n. This is because such a \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n is a square root of 1 modulo \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n, other than 1 and \n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -1}\n\n, whose existence is guaranteed by the Chinese remainder theorem, since \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n is not a prime power.\nWe claim that \n\n\n\nd\n=\ngcd\n\u2061\n(\nb\n\u2212\n1\n,\nN\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d=\\operatorname {gcd} (b-1,N)}\n\n is a proper factor of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n, that is, \n\n\n\nd\n\u2260\n1\n,\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d\\neq 1,N}\n\n. In fact if \n\n\n\nd\n=\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d=N}\n\n, then \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n divides \n\n\n\nb\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b-1}\n\n, so that \n\n\n\nb\n\u2261\n1\n\n\n(\nmod\n\nN\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b\\equiv 1{\\pmod {N}}}\n\n, against the construction of \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n. If on the other hand \n\n\n\nd\n=\ngcd\n\u2061\n(\nb\n\u2212\n1\n,\nN\n)\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d=\\operatorname {gcd} (b-1,N)=1}\n\n, then by B\u00e9zout's identity there are integers \n\n\n\nu\n,\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u,v}\n\n such that\nMultiplying both sides by \n\n\n\nb\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b+1}\n\n we obtain\nSince \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n divides \n\n\n\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\u2261\n\na\n\nr\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n(\nmod\n\nN\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b^{2}-1\\equiv a^{r}-1{\\pmod {N}}}\n\n, we obtain that \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n divides \n\n\n\nb\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b+1}\n\n, so that \n\n\n\nb\n\u2261\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n(\nmod\n\nN\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b\\equiv -1{\\pmod {N}}}\n\n, again contradicting the construction of \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n.\nThus \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n is the required proper factor of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n.\nShor's period-finding algorithm relies heavily on the ability of a quantum computer to be in many states simultaneously. Physicists call this behavior a \"superposition\" of states. To compute the period of a function f, we evaluate the function at all points simultaneously.\nQuantum physics does not allow us to access all this information directly, though. A measurement will yield only one of all possible values, destroying all others. If not for the no cloning theorem, we could first measure f(x) without measuring x, and then make a few copies of the resulting state (which is a superposition of states all having the same f(x)). Measuring x on these states would provide different x values which give the same f(x), leading to the period. Because we cannot make exact copies of a quantum state, this method does not work. Therefore, we have to carefully transform the superposition to another state that will return the correct answer with high probability. This is achieved by the quantum Fourier transform.\nShor thus had to solve three \"implementation\" problems. All of them had to be implemented \"fast\", which means that they can be implemented with a number of quantum gates that is polynomial in \n\n\n\nlog\n\u2061\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log N}\n\n.\nAfter all these transformations a measurement will yield an approximation to the period r. For simplicity assume that there is a y such that yr/Q is an integer. Then the probability to measure y is 1. To see that we notice that then\nfor all integers b. Therefore, the sum whose square gives us the probability to measure y will be Q/r since b takes roughly Q/r values and thus the probability is \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/r^{2}}\n\n. There are r y such that yr/Q is an integer and also r possibilities for \n\n\n\nf\n(\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x_{0})}\n\n, so the probabilities sum to 1.\nNote: another way to explain Shor's algorithm is by noting that it is just the quantum phase estimation algorithm in disguise.\nThe runtime bottleneck of Shor's algorithm is quantum modular exponentiation, which is by far slower than the quantum Fourier transform and classical pre-/post-processing. There are several approaches to constructing and optimizing circuits for modular exponentiation. The simplest and (currently) most practical approach is to mimic conventional arithmetic circuits with reversible gates, starting with ripple-carry adders. Knowing the base and the modulus of exponentiation facilitates further optimizations.[13][14] Reversible circuits typically use on the order of \n\n\n\n\nn\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n^{3}}\n\n gates for \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n qubits. Alternative techniques asymptotically improve gate counts by using quantum Fourier transforms, but are not competitive with less than 600 qubits due to high constants.\nGiven prime \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n with generator \n\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g}\n\n where \n\n\n\n1\n<\ng\n<\np\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1<g<p-1}\n\n, suppose we know that \n\n\n\nx\n=\n\ng\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n(\nmod\n\np\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x=g^{r}{\\pmod {p}}}\n\n, for some r, and we wish to compute r, which is the discrete logarithm: \n\n\n\nr\n=\n\nlog\n\ng\n\n\n\u2061\nx\n\n\n(\nmod\n\np\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r=\\log _{g}x{\\pmod {p-1}}}\n\n.
