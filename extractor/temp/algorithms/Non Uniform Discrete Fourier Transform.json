As a result of this, the computed Discrete Fourier Transform can also consist of unevenly sampled frequency values. It is however also possible to compute uniformly sampled frequency values from an unevenly sampled input signal.\nAs a generalized approach for nonuniform sampling, NDFT allows one to obtain frequency domain information of a finite length signal at any frequency. It can also be used to design the FIR filters as the role of DFT, no matter if it's 1-D or 2-D.\nOne of the reasons to adopt NDFT is that many signals have their energy distributed nonuniformly in the frequency domain. Therefore, a nonuniform sampling scheme could be more convenient and useful in many Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications. For example, NDFT provides a variable spectral resolution controlled by the user.\nNote that NDFT reduces to DFT when the sampling points are located on the unit circle at equally spaced angles.\n\n\n1-D NDFT of a sequence x[n] of length N is[1]\nwhere \n\n\n\nX\n(\nz\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X(z)}\n\n is the Z-transform of \n\n\n\nx\n[\nn\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x[n]}\n\n, and \n\n\n\n{\n\nz\n\ni\n\n\n\n}\n\ni\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nN\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{z_{i}\\}_{i=0,1,...,N-1}}\n\n are arbitrarily distinct points in the z-plane.\nExpressing the above as matrix, we get\nwhere\nAs we can see, the NDFT is characterized by \n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {D} }\n\n and hence the N \n\n\n\n\n\nz\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {z_{k}}}\n\n points. If we further factorize \n\n\n\nd\ne\nt\n(\n\nD\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle det(\\mathbf {D} )}\n\n, we can see that \n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {D} }\n\n is nonsingular provided the N \n\n\n\n\n\nz\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {z_{k}}}\n\n points are distinct. If \n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {D} }\n\n is nonsingular, we can get a unique inverse NDFT as following:\nGiven \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\u00a0and\u00a0\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {X} {\\text{ and }}\\mathbf {D} }\n\n, we can use Gaussian elimination to solve \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} }\n\n. However, the complexity of this method is \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nN\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(N^{3})}\n\n. To solve this problem more efficiently, we first determine \n\n\n\nX\n(\nz\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X(z)}\n\n directly by polynomial interpolation\nthen x[n] is the coefficients of the above interpolating polynomial which can be solved more efficiently. This is illustrated in the next subsection.\nExpressing \n\n\n\nX\n(\nz\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X(z)}\n\n as the Lagrange polynomial of order N-1, we get\nwhere \n\n\n\n{\n\nL\n\ni\n\n\n(\nz\n)\n\n}\n\ni\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nN\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{L_{i}(z)\\}_{i=0,1,...,N-1}}\n\n are the fundamental polynomials:\nExpressing \n\n\n\nX\n(\nz\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X(z)}\n\n by Newton interpolation method, we get\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nc\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{j}}\n\n is the divided difference of the jth order of \n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n^\n\n\n\n[\n0\n]\n,\n\n\n\nX\n^\n\n\n\n[\n1\n]\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n\n\n\nX\n^\n\n\n\n[\nj\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\hat {X}}[0],{\\hat {X}}[1],...,{\\hat {X}}[j]}\n\n with respect to \n\n\n\n\nz\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\nz\n\n1\n\n\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n\nz\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z_{0},z_{1},...,z_{j}}\n\n:\nThe disadvantage of Lagrange representation is that any additional point included will increase the order of the interpolating polynomial, leading to the need of recomputing all the fundamental polynomials. However, any additional point included in Newton representation only require one more term.\nWe can use a lower triangular system to solve \n\n\n\n{\n\nc\n\nj\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{c_{j}\\}}\n\n:\nwhere\nBy the above equation, \n\n\n\n{\n\nc\n\nj\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{c_{j}\\}}\n\n can be computed within \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nN\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(N^{3})}\n\n operations. In this way Newton interpolation is more efficient than Lagrange Interpolation unless the latter is modified by\n2-D NDFT of a sequence \n\n\n\nx\n[\n\nn\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x[n_{1},n_{2}]}\n\n of size \n\n\n\n\nN\n\n1\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nN\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N_{1}\\times N_{2}}\n\n is[2]\nwhere \n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n^\n\n\n\n(\n\nz\n\n1\nk\n\n\n,\n\nz\n\n2\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\hat {X}}(z_{1k},z_{2k})}\n\n is the 2-D z-transform of \n\n\n\nx\n[\n\nn\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x[n_{1},n_{2}]}\n\n, and \n\n\n\n(\n\nz\n\n1\nk\n\n\n,\n\nz\n\n2\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (z_{1k},z_{2k})}\n\n are arbitrarily distinct \n\n\n\n\nN\n\n1\n\n\n\nN\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N_{1}N_{2}}\n\n points in the 4-D \n\n\n\n(\n\nz\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (z_{1},z_{2})}\n\n space.\nAs in the 1-D case, we can express the above equation as\nand the matrix \n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {D} }\n\n is also depends only on the choice of those sampling points.
