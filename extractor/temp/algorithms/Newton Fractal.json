However, for every polynomial of degree at least 2 there are points for which the Newton iteration does not converge to any root: examples are the boundaries of the basins of attraction of the various roots. There are even polynomials for which open sets of starting points fail to converge to any root: a simple example is \n\n\n\n\nz\n\n3\n\n\n\u2212\n2\nz\n+\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z^{3}-2z+2}\n\n, where some points are attracted by the cycle 0,\u00a01,\u00a00,\u00a01\u00a0... rather than by a root.\nAn open set for which the iterations converge towards a given root or cycle (that is not a fixed point), is a Fatou set for the iteration. The complementary set to the union of all these, is the Julia set. The Fatou sets have common boundary, namely the Julia set. Therefore each point of the Julia set is a point of accumulation for each of the Fatou sets. It is this property that causes the fractal structure of the Julia set (when the degree of the polynomial is larger than 2).\nTo plot interesting pictures, one may first choose a specified number \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n of complex points \n\n\n\n(\n\n\u03b6\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\n\u03b6\n\nd\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (\\zeta _{1},\\ldots ,\\zeta _{d})}\n\n and compute the coefficients \n\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\np\n\nd\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (p_{1},\\ldots ,p_{d})}\n\n of the polynomial\nThen for a rectangular lattice \n\n\n\n\nz\n\nm\nn\n\n\n=\n\nz\n\n00\n\n\n+\nm\n\n\u0394\nx\n+\ni\nn\n\n\u0394\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z_{mn}=z_{00}+m\\,\\Delta x+in\\,\\Delta y}\n\n, \n\n\n\nm\n=\n0\n,\n\u2026\n,\nM\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m=0,\\ldots ,M-1}\n\n, \n\n\n\nn\n=\n0\n,\n\u2026\n,\nN\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n=0,\\ldots ,N-1}\n\n of points in \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n, one finds the index \n\n\n\nk\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k(m,n)}\n\n of the corresponding root \n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\nk\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\zeta _{k(m,n)}}\n\n and uses this to fill an \n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n raster grid by assigning to each point \n\n\n\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (m,n)}\n\n a colour \n\n\n\n\nf\n\nk\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{k(m,n)}}\n\n.
