When the system is causal, the ROC is the open region to the right of a vertical line whose abscissa is the real part of the \"largest pole\", or the pole that has the greatest real part of any pole in the system. The real part of the largest pole defining the ROC is called the abscissa of convergence. Therefore, all poles of the system must be in the strict left half of the s-plane for BIBO stability.\nThis stability condition can be derived from the above time-domain condition as follows:\nwhere \n\n\n\ns\n=\n\u03c3\n+\nj\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s=\\sigma +j\\omega }\n\n and \n\n\n\nRe\n\u2061\n(\ns\n)\n=\n\u03c3\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Re} (s)=\\sigma =0}\n\n.\nThe region of convergence must therefore include the imaginary axis.\nFor a rational and discrete time system, the condition for stability is that the region of convergence (ROC) of the z-transform includes the unit circle. When the system is causal, the ROC is the open region outside a circle whose radius is the magnitude of the pole with largest magnitude. Therefore, all poles of the system must be inside the unit circle in the z-plane for BIBO stability.\nThis stability condition can be derived in a similar fashion to the continuous-time derivation:\nwhere \n\n\n\nz\n=\nr\n\ne\n\nj\n\u03c9\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z=re^{j\\omega }}\n\n and \n\n\n\nr\n=\n\n|\n\nz\n\n|\n\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r=|z|=1}\n\n.\nThe region of convergence must therefore include the unit circle.",
