    "full_text": "In numerical analysis, Broyden's method is a quasi-Newton method for finding roots in k variables. It was originally described by C. G. Broyden in 1965.[1]\nNewton's method for solving f(x) = 0 uses the Jacobian matrix, J, at every iteration. However, computing this Jacobian is a difficult and expensive operation. The idea behind Broyden's method is to compute the whole Jacobian only at the first iteration, and to do a rank-one update at the other iterations.\nIn 1979 Gay proved that when Broyden's method is applied to a linear system of size n \u00d7 n, it terminates in 2 n steps,[2] although like all quasi-Newton methods, it may not converge for nonlinear systems.\n\n\nIn the secant method, we replace the first derivative f\u2032 at xn with the finite difference approximation:\nand proceed similar to Newton's Method:\nwhere n is the iteration index.\nTo solve a system of k nonlinear equations\nwhere f is a vector-valued function of vector x:\nFor such problems, Broyden gives a generalization of the one-dimensional Newton's method, replacing the derivative with the Jacobian J. The Jacobian matrix is determined iteratively based on the secant equation in the finite difference approximation:\nwhere n is the iteration index. For clarity, let us define:\nso the above may be rewritten as:\nThe above equation is underdetermined when k is greater than one. Broyden suggests using the current estimate of the Jacobian matrix Jn \u2212 1 and improving upon it by taking the solution to the secant equation that is a minimal modification to Jn \u2212 1:\nThis minimizes the following Frobenius norm:\nWe may then proceed in the Newton direction:\nBroyden also suggested using the Sherman-Morrison formula to update directly the inverse of the Jacobian matrix:\nThis first method is commonly known as the \"good Broyden's method\".\nA similar technique can be derived by using a slightly different modification to Jn \u2212 1. This yields a second method, the so-called \"bad Broyden's method\" (but see[3]):\nThis minimizes a different Frobenius norm:\nMany other quasi-Newton schemes have been suggested in optimization, where one seeks a maximum or minimum by finding the root of the first derivative (gradient in multi dimensions). The Jacobian of the gradient is called Hessian and is symmetric, adding further constraints to its update.\nBroyden has defined not only two methods, but a whole class of methods. Other members of this class have been added by other authors.\nSimple basic explanation: The story of the blind archer",
