It was named after Moshe Zakai.\nAssume the state of the system evolves according to\nand a noisy measurement of the system state is available:\nwhere \n\n\n\nw\n,\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w,v}\n\n are independent Wiener processes. Then the unnormalized conditional probability density \n\n\n\np\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p(x,t)}\n\n of the state at time t is given by the Zakai equation:\nwhere the operator \n\n\n\nL\n=\n\u2212\n\u2211\n\n\n\n\u2202\n(\n\nf\n\ni\n\n\np\n)\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n2\n\n\np\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L=-\\sum {\\frac {\\partial (f_{i}p)}{\\partial x_{i}}}+{\\frac {1}{2}}\\sum {\\frac {\\partial ^{2}p}{\\partial x_{i}\\partial x_{j}}}}\n\n\nAs previously mentioned p is an unnormalized density, i.e. it does not necessarily integrate to 1. After solving for p integration and normalization can be done if desired (an extra step not required in the Kushner approach).\nNote that if the last two terms on the right hand side are omitted (by choosing h identically zero), the result is a nonstochastic PDE\u00a0: the familiar Kolmogorov Forward Equation, which describes the evolution of the state when no measurement information is available.",
