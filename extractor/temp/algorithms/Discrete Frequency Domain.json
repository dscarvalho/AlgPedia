    "full_text": "A discrete frequency domain is a frequency domain that is discrete rather than continuous.\nFor example, the discrete Fourier transform maps a function having a discrete time domain into one having a discrete frequency domain. The discrete-time Fourier transform, on the other hand, maps functions with discrete time (discrete-time signals) to functions that have a continuous frequency domain.[1][2]",
