For a world represented by a grid of blocked and unblocked cells, the brute-force way to find an any-angle path is to search the corresponding visibility graph. This is problematic since the number of edges in a graph with \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V}\n\n vertices is \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nV\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(V^{2})}\n\n. Searching the discrete grid graph can be done quickly since the number of grows linearly with the number of vertices, but the paths are not optimal since since the angle of the turns are constrained to 45\u00b0 or 90\u00b0, which will add turns and increase the overall length of the path. Smoothing a grid-constrained path after does not fix this problem since the algorithm that found that path did not look at all possible paths. Any-angle path planning algorithms find shorter paths than the grid-constrained algorithms while taking roughly same amount of time to compute.[citation needed]\nSo far, four main any-angle path planning algorithms that are based on the heuristic search algorithm A*[2] have been developed, all of which propagate information along grid edges:\nBesides, for search in high-dimensional search spaces, such as when the configuration space of the system involves many degrees of freedom that need to be considered (see Motion planning), and/or momentum needs to be considered (which could effectively double the number of dimensions of the search space; this larger space including momentum is known as the phase space), variants of the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT)[15] have been developed that (almost surely) converge to the optimal path by increasingly finding shorter and shorter paths:\nHybrid A* was created by Stanford Racing as part of the navigation system for Junior, their entry to the DARPA Urban Challenge.[19] Hybrid A* is continuous and tracks the vehicle's position and orientation. This ensures that the path generated can be followed by the vehicle, unlike the paths generated by A* for Field D*, which both produce sharp turns, and do not consider the geometry or movement constrains of the vehicle.",
