    "about": "Impulse invariance is a technique for designing discrete-time infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters from continuous-time filters in which the impulse response of the continuous-time system is sampled to produce the impulse response of the discrete-time system. The frequency response of the discrete-time system will be a sum of shifted copies of the frequency response of the continuous-time system; if the continuous-time system is approximately band-limited to a frequency less than the Nyquist frequency of the sampling, then the frequency response of the discrete-time system will be approximately equal to it for frequencies below the Nyquist frequency.",

The bilinear transform is an alternative to impulse invariance that uses a different mapping that maps the continuous-time system's frequency response, out to infinite frequency, into the range of frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency in the discrete-time case, as opposed to mapping frequencies linearly with circular overlap as impulse invariance does.\nIf the continuous poles at \n\n\n\ns\n=\n\ns\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s=s_{k}}\n\n, the system function can be written in partial fraction expansion as\nThus, using the inverse Laplace transform, the impulse response is\nThe corresponding discrete-time system's impulse response is then defined as the following\nPerforming a z-transform on the discrete-time impulse response produces the following discrete-time system function\nThus the poles from the continuous-time system function are translated to poles at z = eskT. The zeros, if any, are not so simply mapped.[clarification needed]\nIf the system function has zeros as well as poles, they can be mapped the same way, but the result is no longer an impulse invariance result: the discrete-time impulse response is not equal simply to samples of the continuous-time impulse response. This method is known as the matched Z-transform method, or pole\u2013zero mapping. In the case of all-pole filters, the methods are equivalent.\nSince poles in the continuous-time system at s = sk transform to poles in the discrete-time system at z = exp(skT), poles in the left half of the s-plane map to inside the unit circle in the z-plane; so if the continuous-time filter is causal and stable, then the discrete-time filter will be causal and stable as well.\nWhen a causal continuous-time impulse response has a discontinuity at \n\n\n\nt\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t=0}\n\n, the expressions above are not consistent.[1] This is because \n\n\n\n\nh\n\nc\n\n\n(\n0\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h_{c}(0)}\n\n should really only contribute half its value to \n\n\n\nh\n[\n0\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h[0]}\n\n.\nMaking this correction gives\nPerforming a z-transform on the discrete-time impulse response produces the following discrete-time system function\n",
