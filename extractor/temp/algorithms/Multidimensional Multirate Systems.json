Polyphase decomposition and maximally decimated reconstruction systems are already carried out.\nMD decimation / interpolation filters derived from 1-D filters and maximally decimated filter banks are widely used and constitute important steps in the design of multidimensional multirate systems.\n\n\nDecimation and interpolation are necessary steps to create multidimensional multirate systems. In the one dimensional system, decimation and interpolation can be seen in the figure.\nTheoretically, explanations of decimation and interpolation are:[1]\n\u2022 Decimation (Down-sampling):\nThe M times decimated version of x(n) is defined as y(n)= x(Mn), where M is a nonsingular integer matrix called decimation matrix.\nIn the frequency domain, relation becomes\nwhere\nAbove expression changes in multidimensional case, In 2-D case M matrix becomes 2x2 and the region becomes parallel-ogram which is defined as:\n\n\n\n\nM\n[\n0\n,\n0\n]\n\u22c5\n\nw\n\n0\n\n\n+\nM\n[\n1\n,\n0\n]\n\u22c5\n\nw\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M[0,0]\\cdot w_{0}+M[1,0]\\cdot w_{1}}\n\n will be in the range of \n\n\n\n[\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n,\n\u03c0\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [-\\pi ,\\pi )}\n\n and \n\n\n\nM\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\u22c5\n\nw\n\n0\n\n\n+\nM\n[\n1\n,\n1\n]\n\u22c5\n\nw\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M[0,1]\\cdot w_{0}+M[1,1]\\cdot w_{1}}\n\n will be in the range of \n\n\n\n[\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n,\n\u03c0\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [-\\pi ,\\pi )}\n\n\n\u2022 Expansion (Up-sampling):\nThe L times up sampled version of x(n) defined as Y(n)= x(L\u22121 . n), where n is in the range of lattice generated by L which is L*m. The matrix L is called expansion matrix.\nIn the one dimensional systems, the decimator term is used for decimation filter and expander term is used for interpolation filter. The decimator filters generally have the range of [-\u03c0 / M, \u03c0 / M], where M is decimation matrix. In the multidimensional decimation and expansion, the passband changes to:\nwhere x in the range of [-1, 1)D [1]\nWhen M matrix is not diagonal, the filters are not separable. The complexity of non-separable filters increase with increasing number of dimension. Design procedure and example:[1]\nIn detail, By using prototype filter \n\n\n\nP\n(\nw\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P(w)}\n\n, MD multirate filter can be defined as;\nfor k=D-1, where D represents number of dimensions:\nThis is separable low pass filter and its impulse response will be;\nwhere k=D-1, where D represents number of dimensions:\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\ns\n\n\n(\nn\n)\n=\np\n(\n\nn\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\u22c5\np\n(\n\nn\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\u2026\np\n(\n\nn\n\nk\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u220f\n\ni\n=\n0\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\ns\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\u22c5\n\nn\n\ni\n\n\n\n\nJ\n(\nM\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\u03c0\n\u22c5\n\nn\n\ni\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h_{s}(n)=p(n_{0})\\cdot p(n_{1})\\dots p(n_{k})=\\prod _{i=0}^{k}{\\frac {sin{\\frac {\\pi \\cdot n_{i}}{J(M)}}}{(\\pi \\cdot n_{i})}}}\n\n\nNow, considering \n\n\n\n\nh\n\n(\ns\n)\n\n\n(\nM\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h^{(s)}(Mn)}\n\n, M times decimated version of \n\n\n\n\nh\n\n(\ns\n)\n\n\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h^{(s)}(n)}\n\n, since:\n\n\n\n\nM\n\u22c5\nn\n=\nJ\n(\nM\n)\n\u22c5\n\nM\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\u22c5\nn\n=\nJ\n(\nM\n)\n\u22c5\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M\\cdot n=J(M)\\cdot M^{-1}\\cdot n=J(M)\\cdot m}\n\n\nwe get:\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\nJ\n(\nM\n\n)\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u220f\n\ni\n=\n0\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\ns\ni\nn\n(\n\u03c0\n\u22c5\n\nm\n\ni\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u03c0\n\u22c5\n\nm\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {1}{J(M)^{D}}}\\prod _{i=0}^{k}{\\frac {sin(\\pi \\cdot m_{i})}{\\pi \\cdot m_{i}}}}\n\n\nThis process basically shows how to derive MD multirate filter from 1-D filter.\nWhen the number of channel is equal to J(M), this is called a maximally decimated filter bank.
