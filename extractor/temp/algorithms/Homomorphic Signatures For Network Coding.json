In other words \n\n\n\ny\n=\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y=v}\n\n in \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{p}}\n\n. This contradicts the assumption that \n\n\n\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (x,y)}\n\n and \n\n\n\n(\nu\n,\nv\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (u,v)}\n\n are distinct pairs in \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{2}}\n\n. Thus we have that \n\n\n\nQ\n=\n\u2212\n(\nx\n\u2212\nu\n)\n(\ny\n\u2212\nv\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q=-(x-u)(y-v)^{-1}P}\n\n, where the inverse is taken as modulo \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n.\nIf we have r > 2 then we can do one of two things. Either we can take \n\n\n\n\nP\n\n1\n\n\n=\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{1}=P}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nP\n\n2\n\n\n=\nQ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{2}=Q}\n\n as before and set \n\n\n\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\n=\nO\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{i}=O}\n\n for \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n > 2 (in this case the proof reduces to the case when \n\n\n\nr\n=\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r=2}\n\n), or we can take \n\n\n\n\nP\n\n1\n\n\n=\n\nr\n\n1\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{1}=r_{1}P}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\nr\n\ni\n\n\nQ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{i}=r_{i}Q}\n\n where \n\n\n\n\nr\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{i}}\n\n are chosen at random from \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{p}}\n\n. We get one equation in one unknown (the discrete log of \n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q}\n\n). It is quite possible that the equation we get does not involve the unknown. However, this happens with very small probability as we argue next. Suppose the algorithm for Hash-Collision gave us that\nThen as long as \n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n2\n\u2264\ni\n\u2264\nr\n\n\n\nb\n\ni\n\n\n\nr\n\ni\n\n\n\u2262\n0\n\nmod\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sum _{2\\leq i\\leq r}b_{i}r_{i}\\not \\equiv 0{\\bmod {p}}}\n\n, we can solve for the discrete log of Q. But the \n\n\n\n\nr\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{i}}\n\n\u2019s are unknown to the oracle for Hash-Collision and so we can interchange the order in which this process occurs. In other words, given \n\n\n\n\nb\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b_{i}}\n\n, for \n\n\n\n2\n\u2264\ni\n\u2264\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2\\leq i\\leq r}\n\n, not all zero, what is the probability that the \n\n\n\n\nr\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{i}}\n\n\u2019s we chose satisfies \n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n2\n\u2264\ni\n\u2264\nr\n\n\n(\n\nb\n\ni\n\n\n\nr\n\ni\n\n\n)\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sum _{2\\leq i\\leq r}(b_{i}r_{i})=0}\n\n? It is clear that the latter probability is \n\n\n\n\n1\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1 \\over p}\n\n . Thus with high probability we can solve for the discrete log of \n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q}\n\n.\nWe have shown that producing hash collisions in this scheme is difficult. The other method by which an adversary can foil our system is by forging a signature. This scheme for the signature is essentially the Aggregate Signature version of the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signature scheme.[4] Here it is shown that forging a signature is at least as hard as solving the elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman problem. The only known way to solve this problem on elliptic curves is via computing discrete-logs. Thus forging a signature is at least as hard as solving the computational co-Diffie\u2013Hellman on elliptic curves and probably as hard as computing discrete-logs.",
