Examples include\nwhich arises in discussing the regular pentagon, and more complicated ones such as\n\n\nSome nested radicals can be rewritten in a form that is not nested. For example,\nRewriting a nested radical in this way is called denesting. This process is generally considered a difficult problem, although a special class of nested radical can be denested by assuming it denests into a sum of two surds:\nSquaring both sides of this equation yields:\nThis can be solved by finding two numbers such that their sum is equal to a and their product is b2c/4, or by equating coefficients of like terms\u2014setting rational and irrational parts on both sides of the equation equal to each other. The solutions for e and d can be obtained by first equating the rational parts:\nwhich gives\nFor the irrational parts note that\nand squaring both sides yields\nBy plugging in a \u2212 d for e one obtains\nRearranging terms will give a quadratic equation which can be solved for d using the quadratic formula:\nSince a = d+e, the solution e is the algebraic conjugate of d.

Among them are the following:[1]\nOther odd-looking radicals inspired by Ramanujan include:\nIn 1989 Susan Landau introduced the first algorithm for deciding which nested radicals can be denested.[3] Earlier algorithms worked in some cases but not others.\nIn trigonometry, the sines and cosines of many angles can be expressed in terms of nested radicals. For example,\nand\nNested radicals appear in the algebraic solution of the cubic equation. Any cubic equation can be written in simplified form without a quadratic term, as\nwhose general solution for one of the roots is\nIn the case in which the cubic has only one real root, the real root is given by this expression with the radicands of the cube roots being real and with the cube roots being the real cube roots. In the case of three real roots, the square root expression is an imaginary number; here any real root is expressed by defining the first cube root to be any specific complex cube root of the complex radicand, and by defining the second cube root to be the complex conjugate of the first one. The nested radicals in this solution cannot in general be simplified unless the cubic equation has at least one rational solution. Indeed, if the cubic has three irrational but real solutions, we have the casus irreducibilis, in which all three real solutions are written in terms of cube roots of complex numbers. On the other hand, consider the equation\nwhich has the rational solutions 1, 2, and \u20143. The general solution formula given above gives the solutions\nFor any given choice of cube root and its conjugate, this contains nested radicals involving complex numbers, yet it is reducible (even though not obviously so) to one of the solutions 1, 2, or \u20133.\nUnder certain conditions infinitely nested square roots such as\nrepresent rational numbers. This rational number can be found by realizing that x also appears under the radical sign, which gives the equation\nIf we solve this equation, we find that x = 2 (the second solution x =\u00a0\u22121 doesn't apply, under the convention that the positive square root is meant). This approach can also be used to show that generally, if n\u00a0>\u00a00, then\nand is the positive root of the equation x2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0x\u00a0\u2212\u00a0n\u00a0=\u00a00. For n = 1, this root is the golden ratio \u03c6, approximately equal to 1.618. The same procedure also works to obtain\nwhich is the positive root of the equation x2\u00a0+\u00a0x\u00a0\u2212\u00a0n\u00a0=\u00a00.\nRamanujan posed the following problem to the Journal of Indian Mathematical Society:\nThis can be solved by noting a more general formulation:\nSetting this to F(x) and squaring both sides gives us\nwhich can be simplified to\nIt can then be shown that\nSo, setting a\u00a0=\u00a00, n\u00a0=\u00a01, and\u00a0x\u00a0=\u00a02, we have\nRamanujan stated the following infinite radical denesting in his lost notebook:\nThe repeating pattern of the signs is \n\n\n\n(\n+\n,\n+\n,\n\u2212\n,\n+\n)\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (+,+,-,+).}\n\n\nVi\u00e8te's formula for pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, is\nIn certain cases, infinitely nested cube roots such as\ncan represent rational numbers as well. Again, by realizing that the whole expression appears inside itself, we are left with the equation\nIf we solve this equation, we find that\u00a0x\u00a0=\u00a02. More generally, we find that\nis a real root of the equation x3\u00a0\u2212\u00a0x\u00a0\u2212\u00a0n\u00a0=\u00a00 for all\u00a0n\u00a0>\u00a00. For n = 1, this root is the plastic number \u03c1, approximately equal to 1.3247.\nThe same procedure also works to get\nas the real root of the equation x3\u00a0+\u00a0x\u00a0\u2212\u00a0n\u00a0=\u00a00 for all n\u00a0>\u00a00.\nThe value obtained for the infinite nested radical by converting to a polynomial equation and solving is valid only if the sequence of values, obtained by successively nesting more and more radicals, converges. For example, the above-considered expression\nif convergent, is the limiting value of the process\nstarting from the initial value \n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {n}}.}\n\n We have\nConvergence requires that the absolute value of this expression be less than 1 in the neighborhood of the value of x given earlier that satisfies the corresponding polynomial equation. It turns out that this condition is that n > 3/4, which holds if, for example, we require the positive number n to be an integer. Then it is sufficient for convergence that the initial value \n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {n}}}\n\n be in the basin of attraction of the indicated stationary value of x.",
