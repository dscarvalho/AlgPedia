    "about": "The phi-hiding assumption or \u03a6-hiding assumption is an assumption about the difficulty of finding small factors of \u03c6(m) where m is a number whose factorization is unknown, and \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. The security of many modern cryptosystems comes from the perceived difficulty of certain problems. Since P vs. NP problem is still unresolved, cryptographers cannot be sure computationally intractable problems exist. Cryptographers thus make assumptions as to which problems are hard. It is commonly believed that if m is the product of two large primes, then calculating \u03c6(m) is currently computationally infeasible; this assumption is required for the security of the RSA Cryptosystem. The \u03a6-Hiding assumption is a stronger assumption, namely that if p1 and p2 are small primes exactly one of which divides \u03c6(m), there is no polynomial-time algorithm which can distinguish which of the primes p1 and p2 divides \u03c6(m) with probability significantly greater than one-half.",
