This frequency-domain representation is an alternative to the more familiar time-domain waveform, and the two versions are mathematically related by the Fourier transform.\nThe spectrum is of particular interest when pulses are subject to signal processing. For example, when a chirp pulse is compressed by its matched filter, the resulting waveform contains not only a main narrow pulse but, also, a variety of unwanted artifacts many of which are directly attributable to features in the chirp's spectral characteristics.\nThe simplest way to derive the spectrum of a chirp, now computers are widely available, is to sample the time-domain waveform at a frequency well above the Nyquist limit and call up an FFT algorithm to obtain the desired result. As this approach was not an option for the early designers, they resorted to analytic analysis, where possible, or to graphical or approximation methods, otherwise. These early methods still remain helpful, however, as they give additional insight into the behavior and properties of chirps.\n\n\nA general expression for an oscillatory waveform, centered on frequency \u03c90 is\n\n\n\n\ns\n(\nt\n)\n=\na\n(\nt\n)\n.\ne\nx\np\n[\nj\n(\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n\n.\nt\n+\n\u03b8\n(\nt\n)\n)\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s(t)=a(t).exp[j(\\omega _{0}.t+\\theta (t))]}\n\n\nwhere a(t) and \u03b80(t) give the amplitude and phase variations of the waveform s, with time.\nThe frequency spectrum of this waveform is obtained by calculating the Fourier Transform of s(t), i.e.\n\n\n\n\nS\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n=\n\n\u222b\n\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\ns\n(\nt\n)\n.\ne\nx\np\n(\n\u2212\nj\n\u03c9\nt\n)\n.\nd\nt\n=\n\n\u222b\n\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\na\n(\nt\n)\n.\ne\nx\np\n[\nj\n(\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n\nt\n+\n\u03b8\n(\nt\n)\n)\n]\n.\ne\nx\np\n(\n\u2212\nj\n\u03c9\nt\n)\n.\nd\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(\\omega )=\\int _{-\\infty }^{\\infty }s(t).exp(-j\\omega t).dt=\\int _{-\\infty }^{\\infty }a(t).exp[j(\\omega _{0}t+\\theta (t))].exp(-j\\omega t).dt}\n\n\nso\n\n\n\n\nS\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n=\n\n\u222b\n\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\na\n(\nt\n)\n.\ne\nx\np\n[\nj\n\n{\n(\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03c9\n)\n.\nt\n+\n\u03b8\n(\nt\n)\n}\n\n]\n.\nd\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(\\omega )=\\int _{-\\infty }^{\\infty }a(t).exp[j\\left\\{(\\omega _{0}-\\omega ).t+\\theta (t)\\right\\}].dt}\n\n\nIn a few special cases, the integral can be solved to give an analytical expression, but often the characteristics of a(t) and \u03b8(t) are such that the integral can only be evaluated by an approximation algorithm or by numerical integration.\nIn the special case where a(t) is constrained to be a flat topped pulse with its instantaneous frequency varying as a linear function of time, then an analytical solution is possible.\nFor convenience, the pulse is considered to have unit amplitude and be of duration T, with the amplitude and phase defined over the time interval -T/2 to +T/2.

This product, T.\u0394F, is often referred to as the time-bandwidth product of the chirp.\nTables of the Fresnel integrals have been published,[1]:32\u201335[2]:321\u2013322 together with mathematical routines with which to compute the integrals manually or by means of a computer program. In addition, a number of mathematical software programs, such as Mathcad, MATLAB and Mathematica have built-in routines to evaluate the integrals, either as standard functions or in extension packages.\nSome plots of the power spectrum |S(\u03c9)|2 as a function of frequency are shown, for time-bandwidth products of 25, 100, 250 and 1000. When the product is small, the Fresnel ripples are very much in evidence, but the spectrum does tend to a more rectangular profile for larger values.\n\n\nIn the case of the plots of residual phase, \u03a62(\u03c9), the profiles tend to be very similar over a wide range of time-bandwidth products. Two examples, for TxB = 100 and 250 are shown below. They have a phase angle close to a value of \u03c0/4 within the chirp range \n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n\n\u00b1\n\u0394\n\u03a9\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega _{0}\\pm \\Delta \\Omega /2}\n\n and they only start to change significantly for frequencies beyond this range.\n\nConsequently, for frequencies within the sweep range of the chirp, it is the square-law phase term \u03a61(\u03c9) and its group delay function ( = -d\u03a61/d(\u03c9) ) that are of most interest. There is a plot of the group delay shown below. Both this function and the phase \u03a61(\u03c9) are independent of the value of the time-bandwidth product. As expected, the group delay is a linear function with a duration T secs, over a frequency sweep of \u0394\u03a9 rads.\nThe residual phase term adds only minor perturbations to this characteristic within the frequency range \n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n\n\u00b1\n\u0394\n\u03a9\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega _{0}\\pm \\Delta \\Omega /2}\n\n. At frequencies outside this range, \u03a62(\u03c9) deviates rapidly from \u03c0/4, and so the total phase will deviate seriously from a square law there. Fortunately, the energy content of the chirp spectrum is very small at these frequencies (as is demonstrated in a later section).\nWhen the Frequency-Time characteristic is non-linear, the Fourier integral is difficult to evaluate. In such cases, it is possible to resort to an approximation method such as the stationary phase approximation, or to use numerical methods.\nOften (as in radar applications) a(t) is a slowly varying function of time and the phase \u03b8(t) is oscillatory and varies rapidly, over the range of integration. With such waveforms, the stationary phase approximation can be used to investigate the spectrum.[6]:34[8][9][10] The method relies on the fact that the major contributions to the Fourier integral come from the region where the rate of change of phase is minimal, i.e. when\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nd\nt\n\n\n\n[\n(\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03c9\n)\nt\n+\n\u03b8\n(\nt\n)\n]\n=\n0\n]\n\no\nr\n\n(\n\u03c9\n\u2212\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\n\u2032\n\n(\nt\n)\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {d}{dt}}[(\\omega _{0}-\\omega )t+\\theta (t)]=0]\\qquad or\\qquad (\\omega -\\omega _{0})-\\theta '(t)=0}\n\n\nUnless \u03b8(t) is a constant, the point in time ts at which the phase is stationary will vary according to the instantaneous frequency \u03c9s.\nExpressing the difference between (\u03c9s-\u03c90).t and \u03b8(t) as a Taylor series about the time ts, but discarding all but the first three terms (of which the second term is zero, here), the Fourier integral can be written, approximately, as\n\n\n\n\nS\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n\u224a\na\n(\n\nt\n\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\u222b\n\n\nt\n\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03b4\n\n\n\nt\n\ns\n\n\n+\n\u03b4\n\n\ne\nx\np\n\n[\n\u2212\nj\n\n{\n(\n\n\u03c9\n\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n\n)\n.\nt\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n(\n\nt\n\ns\n\n\n)\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\u2033\n\n(\n\nt\n\ns\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n.\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\nt\n\ns\n\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n}\n\n]\n\n.\nd\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(\\omega )\\approxeq a(t_{s})\\int _{t_{s}-\\delta }^{t_{s}+\\delta }exp\\left[-j\\left\\{(\\omega _{s}-\\omega _{0}).t-\\theta (t_{s})-{\\frac {\\theta ''(t_{s})}{2}}.(t-t_{s})^{2}\\right\\}\\right].dt}\n\n\nIn this equation ts represents a constant time point, so terms depending on ts alone may be taken outside the integral.

Several examples of the procedure are given in the literature[6]:43[8][10]\nAlthough the relationships are only approximate, their accuracy improves as the time-bandwidth product increases. In cases where the signal envelope and spectrum modulus are defined by smoothly varying Gaussian function then a T.\u0394F product as low as 15 will give acceptable results, but if both a(t) and |S(\u03c9)| are defined by rectangular functions, then the product T.\u0394F needs to be much greater, typically over 100.[6]:49\nTypically, in the radar case, a(t) is a constant over the duration of the signal and, for convenience, is assumed here to be unity.

The result is only approximate, but is more accurate for large values of the time bandwidth product.\nConsider, as an example, the case of a spectrum that is uniform over the range -\u03c9max/2 to \u03c9max/2, then\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\nS\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\nA\n\nf\no\nr\n\n\n|\n\n\u03c9\n\n|\n\n<\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |S(\\omega )|^{2}=A\\qquad for\\qquad |\\omega |<{\\frac {\\omega _{max}}{2}}}\n\n\nso\n\n\n\n\nD\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n=\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n.\n\u222b\nA\n.\nd\n\u03c9\n+\nK\n=\n\n\nA\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n.\n\u03c9\n+\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle D(\\omega )={\\frac {1}{2\\pi }}.\\int A.d\\omega +K={\\frac {A}{2\\pi }}.\\omega +K}\n\n\nPut D(-\u03c9max/2) = 0 and D(\u03c9max/2 = T, where T is the pulse duration, then K = T/2 and A = (2\u03c0T)/\u03c9max\nso, finally\n\n\n\n\nD\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n=\nT\n.\n\n[\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle D(\\omega )=T.\\left[{\\frac {1}{2}}+{\\frac {\\omega }{\\omega _{max}}}\\right]}\n\n\nAs expected, a flat topped frequency spectrum corresponds to a linear frequency sweep.\nThe linear chirp is just one special case which, in any case, can be calculated more precisely by the methods of the earlier section. The particular usefulness of the stationary phase method lies in its ability to provide results when the frequency sweep is non linear. In such cases the spectral response can be shaped to meet some desired design criteria, for example, low side-lobes when a chirp is compressed.

Inverting the plot gives the more usual (and more useful) plot of frequency as a function of time, which is also shown.\n\nOther spectral shapes can be investigated in the same way and the results, although approximate, are surprisingly accurate, especially when the time bandwidth product of the pulse is high.\nThe stationary phase method does not predict or deal with Fresnell ripples, so it is unable to offer any means by which these ripples can be minimized. As an example, the figure below shows a chirp spectrum with T.\u0394F =250 obtained for a non-linear chirp aiming to match the Hamming window, using the methods described above. The figure shows that the spectral profile matches the Hamming characteristic quite well, but Fresnell ripples, not predicted by the method, are very much in evidence.\nWhenever a Fourier integral cannot be evaluated by analytical means, an approximate solution is usually possible by numerical analysis. Such a procedure requires the function to be sampled, usually at equi-spaced intervals in time.\nOne consequence of sampling is that the resultant spectrum is periodic in the frequency domain. In addition to the (desired) baseband spectrum, additional versions of the spectrum occur, centered on multiples of the sampling frequency. To ensure that there is no overlapping of frequency data (i.e. no aliasing) the Nyquist sampling theorem must be satisfied. In practice, a sampling rate substantially higher than that dictated by the sampling theorem is advisable[12]:11\nA straightforward way to approximate an integral, such as a Fourier integral, is to use the standard 'rectangle rule' for numerical integration. The method assumes the signal value taken at a sample instant remains constant for one sampling interval, until the next sample is taken. This procedure is sometimes referred to as a 'box-car generator', or a zero order sample and hold.[13]:114[14]:34 If the time interval between samples is W, then sn = s(nW), and the desired integral is obtained, approximately, by summing the rectangular areas.\nThe result so obtained is the convolution of a rectangular pulse with step size W with the impulses located at the sampling instants with weights equal to the sample values.[12]:12 In consequence, the spectrum of interest will have superimposed upon it the frequency response of the sample and hold,[13]:135[14]:36 and the spectrum of the sampled singnal Ss is given by:[12]:12\n\n\n\n\nS\ns\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n)\n=\n\n\n\nW\n(\ns\ni\nn\n\u03c9\nW\n\n/\n\n2\n)\n\n\n\u03c9\nW\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\n.\n\n[\n\n\u2211\n\nn\n=\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\ns\n\nn\n\n\n.\ne\nx\np\n(\n\u2212\nj\nn\n\u03c9\nW\n)\n]\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Ss(\\omega ))={\\frac {W(sin\\omega W/2)}{\\omega W/2}}.\\left[\\sum _{n=-\\infty }^{\\infty }s_{n}.exp(-jn\\omega W)\\right]}\n\n\nThe first part of the expression, i.e. the 'sin(x)/x' part, is the frequency response of the sample and hold. Its amplitude decreases with frequency and it falls to 63% of its peak value at half the sampling frequency and it is zero at multiples of that frequency (since fs =1/W).\nThe second term in the equation is called the Fourier transform of the discrete signal sn.[12]:12[15] It is a continuous function over all \u03c9 and involves an infinite number of summations. In practice the summation process can be truncated to a finite number of samples, N, possibly because the waveform is periodic or zero outside the range of samples. Furthermore, because the same spectrum is endlessly repeated, it is possible to confine interest to spectral data within the range -\u03c9s/2 to +\u03c9s/2.\nAs an example, an exponential chirp (with its top frequency well below the Nyquist limit) is sampled at 256 points, as shown.\nThe sampled spectrum, Ss(\u03c9) of this waveform, calculated using the equation given above, is shown. To simplify the plot, only the results at positive frequencies have been displayed. The influence of the frequency spectrum of the zero order hold circuit is clearly seen in the diagram.\nThe baseband portion of the spectrum is shown in more detail in the next figure and the response shows a distinct slope, being significantly lower at the higher frequencies.\n\nAlthough the characteristic of the zero order hold has a small influence on this result, the slope is mainly due to the properties of the chirp. The waveform sweeps relatively quickly over the high frequencies and spends more time sweeping the low frequencies, consequently there is less energy content at the high frequencies with more at the lower ones. (A linear chirp, on the other hand, has a nominally flat spectrum because its frequencies are swept at the same rate, as shown in some earlier plots).\nIf we limit interest in the output spectrum to a finite number of discrete data points (= N), at frequencies \u03c9m given by\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\nm\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\nm\n\n\nN\nW\n\n\n\n\nf\no\nr\n\nm\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\nN\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega _{m}={\\frac {2\\pi m}{NW}}\\qquad for\\qquad m=0,1,2,...N-1}\n\n\nthen the formula for calculating the discrete Fourier transform is\n\n\n\n\nS\n\ns\n\nm\n\n\n\n=\nS\ns\n\n(\nj\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\nm\n\n\nN\nW\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u2211\n\nn\n=\n0\n\n\nN\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\ns\n\nn\n\n\n.\ne\nx\np\n(\n\u2212\nj\n\n(\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\nm\nn\n\nN\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Ss_{m}\\quad =Ss\\left(j{\\frac {2\\pi m}{NW}}\\right)\\quad =\\quad \\sum _{n=0}^{N-1}s_{n}.exp(-j\\left({\\frac {2\\pi mn}{N}}\\right)}\n\n\nThe calculations can be carried out by means of a straightforward computer algorithm,[12]:21 but this is not very efficient in computer usage. Consequently, more efficient algorithms have been developed, especially Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). Computer programs which implement the FFT are widely available in the literature[12]:54[15]:119,412[16] and in proprietary CAD programs such as Mathcad, MATLAB, and Mathematica.\nIn the following example a linear chirp with time bandwidth product of 25 is sampled at 128 points (i.e. N = 128). In the figure samples of the real part of the waveform are shown - note that these are samples in the time domain. The FFT process assumes the waveform is cyclic, so these 128 data points can be considered to be part of an endlessly repeating sequence in time.\nBy calculating the N-point FFT of this data, the discrete spectrum of the sequence is obtained. The magnitude of this spectrum is shown in the attached figure, where these data points are samples in frequency. The data is cyclic so, in the plot, the zero frequency point is at n = 0 and also at n = 128 (i.e. both points are the same frequency). The point n = 64 corresponds to +fs/2 (and also to -fs/2).\nTo display the spectrum in more detail (but not necessarily with more resolution[17]), the time sequence can be extended by zero padding.[15]:80\u201385[18][19] For example, extending the 128 point time sequence with zeros to give N = 4096 results in that part of the spectrum originally presented in 16 samples, now being presented in 512 samples, as shown.\nThere is very little spectral content beyond the sweep frequency range of a chirp pulse and this is especially true for waveforms where the time-bandwidth product is large. The full line on the graph of the adjacent figure shows results for linear chirps. It shows, for example, that only about 2% of the total power resides at frequencies outside the sweep range \u0394F when the time-bandwidth is 100, and it is less than 1/2% when T.\u0394F is 500.\nIn the case of a non-linear chirp, or a linear chirp shaped by amplitude weighting, the fraction of power outside \u0394F is even lower, as is shown on the graph, where the dashed line is for spectra with Hamming profiles.\nThis low spectral spread is particularly significant when baseband signals are to be digitized since it permits a sampling frequency to be chosen which is only slightly higher than twice the maximum frequency excursion of the chirp.\nThe Fresnel ripples on a chirp spectrum are very obtrusive, especially when time-bandwidth products are low (under 50, say) and their presence leads to high time sidelobe levels when chirps are subject to pulse compression as in radar and sonar systems. They arise because of the sudden discontinuities in the chirp waveform at the commencement and termination of the pulse.\nAlthough there are a number of procedures that can be applied to reduce the ripple levels, they are not all equally effective. Furthermore, some of the methods require amplitude shaping, or amplitude modulation, of the chirp pulse and this makes those methods unsuitable when, for example, the chirp pulses are to be transmitted by a power amplifier operating in a near-limiting condition. For such systems only the methods using frequency (or phase) pre-distortion are appropriate.\nIf the transitions at the start and end of the chirp are made less sudden (or more 'rounded'), then a reduction in ripple amplitude is achieved.[6]:213[20][21] The durations of the two transition regions need only be a small fraction of the pulse duration, and suggested values are between 2/\u0394F and 3/\u0394F [20] but, as expected, when the time-bandwidth product of the pulse is small, longer transition periods are needed. The actual profiles of these rise and fall regions of a pulse do not seem to be critical and may be provided, for example, by band limiting filters in analogue implementations and a linear slope in digital ones.\nTwo examples show the spectra of linear chirps with finite rise-times. The first is for a chirp with time-bandwidth of 250, where the rise and fall times are 4% of the total pulse duration and the second is for a chirp with time-bandwidth of 25, where the rise and fall times are 10% of the total. These two spectra show a marked reduction in ripple amplitude compared to the spectra of unmodified linear chirps shown earlier.\nA analogous technique can be applied to the frequency characteristic of the chirp waveform by adding linear FM distortion segments (quadratic phase modulation distortion) to the frequency characteristic of the chirp, as shown. The method is effective because amplitude and phase distortions having functional similarity can produce similar effects when the distortion factors are small.[20][22]\nSuggested values for these distortion regions, to give good results are:\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\nf\n\np\n\n\n=\n0.75\n\u0394\nF\n\na\nn\nd\n\n\u03b4\n=\n1\n\n/\n\n\u0394\nF\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta f_{p}=0.75\\Delta F\\qquad and\\qquad \\delta =1/\\Delta F}\n\n\nLater work[23] proposed slightly different values, namely:\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\nf\n\np\n\n\n=\n0.73\n\u0394\nF\n\na\nn\nd\n\n\u03b4\n=\n0.86\n\n/\n\n\u0394\nF\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta f_{p}=0.73\\Delta F\\qquad and\\qquad \\delta =0.86/\\Delta F}\n\n\nbut the outcome can doubtless be improved by optimizing values for each particular situation.\nTwo plots show the effects of frequency pre-correction and can be compared to the results in the earlier sections.\nThe ripple reduction achieved by frequency pre-correction, although significant, is seen to be less successful than that achieved by the amplitude modulation methods of the previous section. However, it has been suggested[21] that by implementing cubic (rather than quadratic) phase pre-correction, comparable results can be achieved.\nThis method uses an inverse Fourier transform in order to derive a waveform which has a spectrum with the phase characteristic of a chosen chirp but a new amplitude profile which is rectangular and ripple free. The method is very effective but, unfortunately, the waveform that is so derived has a semi-infinite time duration. If, for convenience, the newly derived waveform is truncated to a practical length, then some ripple is reintroduced onto the spectrum.\nAs an example, a linear chirp waveform with a time bandwidth of 25 is shown together with its spectrum magnitude (shown by a full line) which, as demonstrated earlier, has a large ripple component. It is possible to find, by means of an inverse FFT, a chirp waveform which, in the frequency domain, has the same phase characteristic as before, but with the rectangular magnitude characteristic shown by the dashed line on the plot. The chirp waveform resulting from this process has a very long time duration, but when it is truncated to say, a length 2T, then the spectrum acquires some ripple once more, as shown.\nThere are many applications in which a spectrum with a rectangular magnitude profile is not ideal. For example, when a chirp waveform is compressed by means of its matched filter, then the resultant waveform approximates to the sinc function and, consequently, has annoyingly high sidelobes. Often, to improve the characteristics of the pulse and lower the sidelobe levels, its spectrum is modified, typically to a bell-shaped profile. Similar problems arise in digital signal processing where the spectral shaping is provided by a window function, a process sometimes called apodization. In the case of an antenna array, similar profiling by \"weighting functions\" is used to reduce the spatial sidelobes of the radiation pattern.\nAlthough spectral shaping of a chirp could be applied in the frequency domain, better results are obtained if the shaping is carried out in the time domain.[24][25]\nExamples of this process are shown for linear chirps with time-bandwidth products of 250 and 25. They have been shaped by a 3-term Blackman-Harris window[11] given by\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\nU\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0.42323\n\u2212\n0.49755\nc\no\ns\n\n(\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\n\n\n\u03c9\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n+\n0.07922\nc\no\ns\n\n(\n\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\n\n\n\u03c9\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |U(\\omega )|^{2}=0.42323-0.49755cos\\left({\\frac {2\\pi \\omega }{\\omega _{max}}}\\right)+0.07922cos\\left({\\frac {4\\pi \\omega }{\\omega _{max}}}\\right)}\n\n\nThe spectra, now bell-shaped, are seen to be free of ripples.\nNon-linear chirps can be devised that have a bell shaped spectrum, such as the Blackman-Harris window just discussed, and consequently will exhibit reduced ripple compared to the linear chirp. By means of the stationary phase method described earlier, an approximate relationship between time and frequency can be obtained and is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\nT\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\n+\n0.1871\ns\ni\nn\n\n(\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\n\n\n\u03c9\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n+\n0.014895\ns\ni\nn\n\n(\n\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\n\n\n\u03c9\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {t}{T}}={\\frac {1}{2}}+{\\frac {\\omega }{\\omega _{max}}}+0.1871sin\\left({\\frac {2\\pi \\omega }{\\omega _{max}}}\\right)+0.014895sin\\left({\\frac {4\\pi \\omega }{\\omega _{max}}}\\right)}\n\n\nRearranging the equation, a plot of frequency against time can be plotted, as shown.\nAs examples, plots of the spectral magnitudes of non-linear chirps with spectral profiles of Blackman-Harris windows and with time-bandwidth products of 250 and 25 are shown below. As can be seen, there is some ripple reduction, but the disappointing performance can be attributed to the fact that these chirps, although they have reduced energy content in their outer frequency regions, they still have amplitude profiles with fast rise and fall times.",
