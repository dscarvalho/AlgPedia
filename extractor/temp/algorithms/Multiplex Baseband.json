    "full_text": "In telecommunication, the term multiplex baseband has the following meanings:\nFor example, the output of a group multiplexer consists of a band of frequencies from 60\u00a0kHz to 108\u00a0kHz. This is the group-level baseband that results from combining 12 voice-frequency input channels, having a bandwidth of 4\u00a0kHz each, including guard bands. In turn, 5 groups are multiplexed into a super group having a baseband of 312\u00a0kHz to 552\u00a0kHz. This baseband, however, does not represent a group-level baseband. Ten super groups are in turn multiplexed into one master group, the output of which is a baseband that may be used to modulate a microwave-frequency carrier.\n\u00a0This article incorporates\u00a0public domain material from the General Services Administration document \"Federal Standard 1037C\" (in support of MIL-STD-188).",
