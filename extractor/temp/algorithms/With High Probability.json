For example, consider a certain probabilistic algorithm on a graph with n nodes. If the probability that the algorithm returns the correct answer is \n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n1\n\n/\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1-1/n}\n\n, then when the number of nodes is very large, the algorithm is correct with a probability that is very near 1. This fact is expressed shortly by saying that the algorithm is correct WHP.\nSome algorithms in which this term is used are:",
