Stan is named in honour of Stanislaw Ulam, pioneer of the Monte Carlo method.[1]:xii\n\n\nStan can be accessed through several interfaces:\nStan implements gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian inference, stochastic, gradient-based variational Bayesian methods for approximate Bayesian inference, and gradient-based optimization for penalized maximum likelihood estimation.\nStan implements reverse-mode automatic differentiation to calculate gradients of the model, which is required by HMC, NUTS, L-BFGS, BFGS, and variational inference.[1]:199 The automatic differentiation within Stan can be used outside of the probabilistic programming language.\nStan is used in fields including social science[4] and pharmaceutical statistics.[5]",
