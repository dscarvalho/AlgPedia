    "about": "The alpha max plus beta min algorithm is a high-speed approximation of the square root of the sum of two squares. The square root of the sum of two squares, also known as Pythagorean addition, is a useful function, because it finds the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the two side lengths, the norm of a 2-D vector, or the magnitude of a complex number z=a+bi given the real and imaginary parts.",

    "full_text": "The alpha max plus beta min algorithm is a high-speed approximation of the square root of the sum of two squares. The square root of the sum of two squares, also known as Pythagorean addition, is a useful function, because it finds the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the two side lengths, the norm of a 2-D vector, or the magnitude of a complex number z=a+bi given the real and imaginary parts.\nThe algorithm avoids performing the square and square-root operations, instead using simple operations such as comparison, multiplication, and addition. Some choices of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters of the algorithm allow the multiplication operation to be reduced to a simple shift of binary digits that is particularly well suited to implementation in high-speed digital circuitry.\nThe approximation is expressed as:\nWhere \n\n\n\n\nM\na\nx\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Max} }\n\n is the maximum absolute value of a and b and \n\n\n\n\nM\ni\nn\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Min} }\n\n is the minimum absolute value of a and b.\nFor the closest approximation, the optimum values for \n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha \\,\\!}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta \\,\\!}\n\n are \n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n0\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\ncos\n\u2061\n\n\n\u03c0\n8\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\ncos\n\u2061\n\n\n\u03c0\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n0.96043387...\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha _{0}={\\frac {2\\cos {\\frac {\\pi }{8}}}{1+\\cos {\\frac {\\pi }{8}}}}=0.96043387...}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n0\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\nsin\n\u2061\n\n\n\u03c0\n8\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\ncos\n\u2061\n\n\n\u03c0\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n0.39782473...\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta _{0}={\\frac {2\\sin {\\frac {\\pi }{8}}}{1+\\cos {\\frac {\\pi }{8}}}}=0.39782473...}\n\n, giving a maximum error of 3.96%.",
