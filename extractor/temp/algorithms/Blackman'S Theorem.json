Blackman in 1943,[1] was connected to signal-flow analysis by John Choma, and was made popular in the extra element theorem by R. D. Middlebrook and the asymptotic gain model of Solomon Rosenstark.[2][3][4][5] Blackman's approach leads to the formula for the impedance Z between two selected terminals of a negative feedback amplifier as Blackman's formula:\nwhere ZD = impedance with the feedback disabled, TSC = loop transmission with a small-signal short across the selected terminal pair, and TOC = loop transmission with an open circuit across the terminal pair.[6] The loop transmission also is referred to as the return ratio.[7][8] Blackman's formula can be compared with Middlebrook's result for the input impedance Zin of a circuit based upon the extra-element theorem:[4][9][10]\nwhere:\nBlackman's formula also can be compared with Choma's signal-flow result:[11]\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nZ\n\nS\n0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Z_{S0}\\ }\n\n is the value of \n\n\n\n\nZ\n\nS\nS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Z_{SS}\\ }\n\n under the condition that a selected parameter P is set to zero, return ratio \n\n\n\n\nT\n\nZ\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T_{Z}\\ }\n\n is evaluated with zero excitation and \n\n\n\n\nT\n\nI\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T_{I}\\ }\n\n is \n\n\n\n\nT\n\nZ\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T_{Z}\\ }\n\n for the case of short-circuited source resistance. As with the extra-element result, differences are in the perspective leading to the formula.[10]\n",
