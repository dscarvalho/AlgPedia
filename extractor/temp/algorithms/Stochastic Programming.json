More generally, such models are formulated, solved analytically or numerically, and analyzed in order to provide useful information to a decision-maker.[1]\nAs an example, consider two-stage linear programs. Here the decision maker takes some action in the first stage, after which a random event occurs affecting the outcome of the first-stage decision. A recourse decision can then be made in the second stage that compensates for any bad effects that might have been experienced as a result of the first-stage decision. The optimal policy from such a model is a single first-stage policy and a collection of recourse decisions (a decision rule) defining which second-stage action should be taken in response to each random outcome.\nStochastic programming has applications in a broad range of areas ranging from finance to transportation to energy optimization.[2][3] This article includes an example of optimizing an investment portfolio over time.\n\n\nThe basic idea of two-stage stochastic programming is that (optimal) decisions should be based on data available at the time the decisions are made and cannot depend on future observations. The two-stage formulation is widely used in stochastic programming. The general formulation of a two-stage stochastic programming problem is given by: \n\n\n\n\nmin\n\nx\n\u2208\nX\n\n\n{\ng\n(\nx\n)\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n+\n\nE\n\n\u03be\n\n\n[\nQ\n(\nx\n,\n\u03be\n)\n]\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\min _{x\\in X}\\{g(x)=f(x)+E_{\\xi }[Q(x,\\xi )]\\}}\n\n where \n\n\n\nQ\n(\nx\n,\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q(x,\\xi )}\n\n is the optimal value of the second-stage problem \n\n\n\n\nmin\n\ny\n\n\n{\nq\n(\ny\n,\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n|\n\n\nT\n(\n\u03be\n)\nx\n+\nW\n(\n\u03be\n)\ny\n=\nh\n(\n\u03be\n)\n}\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\min _{y}\\{q(y,\\xi )\\,|\\,T(\\xi )x+W(\\xi )y=h(\\xi )\\}.}\n\n\nThe classical two-stage linear stochastic programming problems can be formulated as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin\n\nx\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\nc\n\nT\n\n\nx\n+\n\nE\n\n\u03be\n\n\n[\nQ\n(\nx\n,\n\u03be\n)\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject to\n\n\n\nA\nx\n=\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{array}{llr}\\min \\limits _{x\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}&g(x)=c^{T}x+E_{\\xi }[Q(x,\\xi )]&\\\\{\\text{subject to}}&Ax=b&\\\\&x\\geq 0&\\end{array}}}\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\nQ\n(\nx\n,\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q(x,\\xi )}\n\n is the optimal value of the second-stage problem \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin\n\ny\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq\n(\n\u03be\n\n)\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject to\n\n\n\nT\n(\n\u03be\n)\nx\n+\nW\n(\n\u03be\n)\ny\n=\nh\n(\n\u03be\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{array}{llr}\\min \\limits _{y\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{m}}&q(\\xi )^{T}y&\\\\{\\text{subject to}}&T(\\xi )x+W(\\xi )y=h(\\xi )&\\\\&y\\geq 0&\\end{array}}}\n\n\nIn such formulation \n\n\n\nx\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n\n is the first-stage decision variable vector, \n\n\n\ny\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{m}}\n\n is the second-stage decision variable vector, and \n\n\n\n\u03be\n(\nq\n,\nT\n,\nW\n,\nh\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi (q,T,W,h)}\n\n contains the data of the second-stage problem. In this formulation, at the first stage we have to make a \"here-and-now\" decision \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n before the realization of the uncertain data \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n, viewed as a random vector, is known. At the second stage, after a realization of \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n becomes available, we optimize our behavior by solving an appropriate optimization problem.\nAt the first stage we optimize (minimize in the above formulation) the cost \n\n\n\n\nc\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c^{T}x}\n\n of the first-stage decision plus the expected cost of the (optimal) second-stage decision. We can view the second-stage problem simply as an optimization problem which describes our supposedly optimal behavior when the uncertain data is revealed, or we can consider its solution as a recourse action where the term \n\n\n\nW\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Wy}\n\n compensates for a possible inconsistency of the system \n\n\n\nT\nx\n\u2264\nh\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Tx\\leq h}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nq\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q^{T}y}\n\n is the cost of this recourse action.\nThe considered two-stage problem is linear because the objective functions and the constraints are linear. Conceptually this is not essential and one can consider more general two-stage stochastic programs. For example, if the first-stage problem is integer, one could add integrality constraints to the first-stage problem so that the feasible set is discrete. Non-linear objectives and constraints could also be incorporated if needed.[4]\nThe formulation of the above two-stage problem assumes that the second-stage data \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n can be modeled as a random vector with a known probability distribution (not just uncertain). This would be justified in many situations. For example \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n could be information derived from historical data and the distribution does not significantly change over the considered period of time. In such situations one may reliably estimate the required probability distribution and the optimization on average could be justified by the law of large numbers. Another example is that \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n could be realizations of a simulation model whose outputs are stochastic. The empirical distribution of the sample could be used as an approximation to the true but unknown output distribution.\nTo solve the two-stage stochastic problem numerically, one often needs to assume that the random vector \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n has a finite number of possible realizations, called scenarios, say \n\n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\n\u03be\n\nK\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi _{1},\\dots ,\\xi _{K}}\n\n, with respective probability masses \n\n\n\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\np\n\nK\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p_{1},\\dots ,p_{K}}\n\n. Then the expectation in the first-stage problem's objective function can be written as the summation: \n\n\n\nE\n[\nQ\n(\nx\n,\n\u03be\n)\n]\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\n\nK\n\n\n\np\n\nk\n\n\nQ\n(\nx\n,\n\n\u03be\n\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E[Q(x,\\xi )]=\\sum \\limits _{k=1}^{K}p_{k}Q(x,\\xi _{k})}\n\n and, moreover, the two-stage problem can be formulated as one large linear programming problem (this is called the deterministic equivalent of the original problem, see section \u00a7\u00a0Deterministic equivalent of a stochastic problem).\nWhen \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n has an infinite (or very large) number of possible realizations the standard approach is then to represent this distribution by scenarios. This approach raises three questions, namely:\nThese questions are not independent. For example, the number of scenarios constructed will affect both the tractability of the deterministic equivalent and the quality of the obtained solutions.\nA stochastic linear program is a specific instance of the classical two-stage stochastic program. A stochastic LP is built from a collection of multi-period linear programs (LPs), each having the same structure but somewhat different data. The \n\n\n\n\nk\n\nt\nh\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k^{th}}\n\n two-period LP, representing the \n\n\n\n\nk\n\nt\nh\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k^{th}}\n\n scenario, may be regarded as having the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimize\n\n\n\n\nf\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\n\ng\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nh\n\nk\n\n\nT\n\n\n\nz\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject to\n\n\n\nT\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\nU\ny\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nk\n\n\ny\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nW\n\nk\n\n\n\nz\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\ns\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n,\n\n\ny\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nz\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\u2265\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{array}{lccccccc}{\\text{Minimize}}&f^{T}x&+&g^{T}y&+&h_{k}^{T}z_{k}&&\\\\{\\text{subject to}}&Tx&+&Uy&&&=&r\\\\&&&V_{k}y&+&W_{k}z_{k}&=&s_{k}\\\\&x&,&y&,&z_{k}&\\geq &0\\end{array}}}\n\n\nThe vectors \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n and \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y}\n\n contain the first-period variables, whose values must be chosen immediately. The vector \n\n\n\n\nz\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z_{k}}\n\n contains all of the variables for subsequent periods. The constraints \n\n\n\nT\nx\n+\nU\ny\n=\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Tx+Uy=r}\n\n involve only first-period variables and are the same in every scenario. The other constraints involve variables of later periods and differ in some respects from scenario to scenario, reflecting uncertainty about the future.\nNote that solving the \n\n\n\n\nk\n\nt\nh\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k^{th}}\n\n two-period LP is equivalent to assuming the \n\n\n\n\nk\n\nt\nh\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k^{th}}\n\n scenario in the second period with no uncertainty. In order to incorporate uncertainties in the second stage, one should assign probabilities to different scenarios and solve the corresponding deterministic equivalent.\nWith a finite number of scenarios, two-stage stochastic linear programs can be modelled as large linear programming problems. This formulation is often called the deterministic equivalent linear program, or abbreviated to deterministic equivalent. (Strictly speaking a deterministic equivalent is any mathematical program that can be used to compute the optimal first-stage decision, so these will exist for continuous probability distributions as well, when one can represent the second-stage cost in some closed form.) For example, to form the deterministic equivalent to the above stochastic linear program, we assign a probability \n\n\n\n\np\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p_{k}}\n\n to each scenario \n\n\n\nk\n=\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k=1,\\dots ,K}\n\n.

The first-period variables \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n and \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y}\n\n are the same in every scenario, however, because we must make a decision for the first period before we know which scenario will be realized. As a result, the constraints involving just \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n and \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y}\n\n need only be specified once, while the remaining constraints must be given separately for each scenario.\nIn practice it might be possible to construct scenarios by eliciting experts' opinions on the future. The number of constructed scenarios should be relatively modest so that the obtained deterministic equivalent can be solved with reasonable computational effort. It is often claimed that a solution that is optimal using only a few scenarios provides more adaptable plans than one that assumes a single scenario only. In some cases such a claim could be verified by a simulation. In theory some measures of guarantee that an obtained solution solves the original problem with reasonable accuracy. Typically in applications only the first stage optimal solution \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{*}}\n\n has a practical value since almost always a \"true\" realization of the random data will be different from the set of constructed (generated) scenarios.\nSuppose \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n contains \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n independent random components, each of which has three possible realizations (for example, future realizations of each random parameters are classified as low, medium and high), then the total number of scenarios is \n\n\n\nK\n=\n\n3\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K=3^{d}}\n\n. Such exponential growth of the number of scenarios makes model development using expert opinion very difficult even for reasonable size \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n. The situation becomes even worse if some random components of \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n have continuous distributions.\nA common approach to reduce the scenario set to a manageable size is by using Monte Carlo simulation. Suppose the total number of scenarios is very large or even infinite. Suppose further that we can generate a sample \n\n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\n\u03be\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\n\u03be\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi ^{1},\\xi ^{2},\\dots ,\\xi ^{N}}\n\n of \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n replications of the random vector \n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi }\n\n.

This can be done in various ways. For example, one can construct a particular scenario tree defining time evolution of the process.

These models are typically many-staged, rather than two-staged.\nStochastic dynamic programming is a useful tool in understanding decision making under uncertainty. The accumulation of capital stock under uncertainty is one example; often it is used by resource economists to analyze bioeconomic problems[disambiguation needed][9] where the uncertainty enters in such as weather, etc.\nAll discrete stochastic programming problems can be represented with any algebraic modeling language, manually implementing explicit or implicit non-anticipativity to make sure the resulting model respects the structure of the information made available at each stage. An instance of an SP problem generated by a general modelling language tends to grow quite large (linearly in the number of scenarios), and its matrix loses the structure that is intrinsic to this class of problems, which could otherwise be exploited at solution time by specific decomposition algorithms. Extensions to modelling languages specifically designed for SP are starting to appear, see:\nThey both can generate SMPS instance level format, which conveys in a non-redundant form the structure of the problem to the solver.",
