    "full_text": "In mathematics, a Liouvillian function is an elementary function or (recursively) the integral of a Liouvillian function.\nMore explicitly, it is a function of one variable which is the composition of a finite number of arithmetic operations (+ \u2013 \u00d7 \u00f7), exponentials, constants, solutions of algebraic equations (a generalization of nth roots), and antiderivatives. The logarithm function does not need to be explicitly included since it is the integral of \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/x}\n\n.\nIt follows directly from the definition that the set of Liouvillian functions is closed under arithmetic operations, composition, and integration. It is also closed under differentiation. It is not closed under limits and infinite sums.\nLiouvillian functions were introduced by Joseph Liouville in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841.\n\n\nAll elementary functions are Liouvillian.\nExamples of well-known functions which are Liouvillian but not elementary are the nonelementary integrals, for example:\nAll Liouvillian functions are solutions of algebraic differential equations, but not conversely. Examples of functions which are solutions of algebraic differential equations but not Liouvillian include:[1]\nExamples of functions which are not solutions of algebraic differential equations and thus not Liouvillian include all transcendentally transcendental functions, such as:",
