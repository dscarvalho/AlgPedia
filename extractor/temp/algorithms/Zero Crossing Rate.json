    "about": "The zero-crossing rate is the rate of sign-changes along a signal, i.e., the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back.[1] This feature has been used heavily in both speech recognition and music information retrieval, being a key feature to classify percussive sounds.[2]",
