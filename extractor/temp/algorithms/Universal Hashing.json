Many universal families are known (for hashing integers, vectors, strings), and their evaluation is often very efficient. Universal hashing has numerous uses in computer science, for example in implementations of hash tables, randomized algorithms, and cryptography.\n\n\nAssume we want to map keys from some universe \n\n\n\nU\n\n\n{\\displaystyle U}\n\n into \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n bins (labelled \n\n\n\n[\nm\n]\n=\n{\n0\n,\n\u2026\n,\nm\n\u2212\n1\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [m]=\\{0,\\dots ,m-1\\}}\n\n). The algorithm will have to handle some data set \n\n\n\nS\n\u2286\nU\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S\\subseteq U}\n\n of \n\n\n\n\n|\n\nS\n\n|\n\n=\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |S|=n}\n\n keys, which is not known in advance. Usually, the goal of hashing is to obtain a low number of collisions (keys from \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n that land in the same bin). A deterministic hash function cannot offer any guarantee in an adversarial setting if the size of \n\n\n\nU\n\n\n{\\displaystyle U}\n\n is greater than \n\n\n\nm\n\u22c5\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m\\cdot n}\n\n, since the adversary may choose \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n to be precisely the preimage of a bin. This means that all data keys land in the same bin, making hashing useless. Furthermore, a deterministic hash function does not allow for rehashing: sometimes the input data turns out to be bad for the hash function (e.g. there are too many collisions), so one would like to change the hash function.\nThe solution to these problems is to pick a function randomly from a family of hash functions. A family of functions \n\n\n\nH\n=\n{\nh\n:\nU\n\u2192\n[\nm\n]\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H=\\{h:U\\to [m]\\}}\n\n is called a universal family if, \n\n\n\n\u2200\nx\n,\ny\n\u2208\nU\n,\n\u00a0\nx\n\u2260\ny\n:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPr\n\nh\n\u2208\nH\n\n\n[\nh\n(\nx\n)\n=\nh\n(\ny\n)\n]\n\u2264\n\n\n1\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\forall x,y\\in U,~x\\neq y:~~\\Pr _{h\\in H}[h(x)=h(y)]\\leq {\\frac {1}{m}}}\n\n.\nIn other words, any two keys of the universe collide with probability at most \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/m}\n\n when the hash function \n\n\n\nh\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h}\n\n is drawn randomly from \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n. This is exactly the probability of collision we would expect if the hash function assigned truly random hash codes to every key. Sometimes, the definition is relaxed to allow collision probability \n\n\n\nO\n(\n1\n\n/\n\nm\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(1/m)}\n\n. This concept was introduced by Carter and Wegman[1] in 1977, and has found numerous applications in computer science (see, for example [2]). If we have an upper bound of \n\n\n\n\u03f5\n<\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\epsilon <1}\n\n on the collision probability, we say that we have \n\n\n\n\u03f5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\epsilon }\n\n-almost universality.\nMany, but not all, universal families have the following stronger uniform difference property:\nNote that the definition of universality is only concerned with whether \n\n\n\nh\n(\nx\n)\n\u2212\nh\n(\ny\n)\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h(x)-h(y)=0}\n\n, which counts collisions. The uniform difference property is stronger.\n(Similarly, a universal family can be XOR universal if \n\n\n\n\u2200\nx\n,\ny\n\u2208\nU\n,\n\u00a0\nx\n\u2260\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\forall x,y\\in U,~x\\neq y}\n\n, the value \n\n\n\nh\n(\nx\n)\n\u2295\nh\n(\ny\n)\n\u00a0\n\nmod\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h(x)\\oplus h(y)~{\\bmod {~}}m}\n\n is uniformly distributed in \n\n\n\n[\nm\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [m]}\n\n where \n\n\n\n\u2295\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\oplus }\n\n is the bitwise exclusive or operation. This is only possible if \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n is a power of two.)\nAn even stronger condition is pairwise independence: we have this property when \n\n\n\n\u2200\nx\n,\ny\n\u2208\nU\n,\n\u00a0\nx\n\u2260\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\forall x,y\\in U,~x\\neq y}\n\n we have the probability that \n\n\n\nx\n,\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x,y}\n\n will hash to any pair of hash values \n\n\n\n\nz\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z_{1},z_{2}}\n\n is as if they were perfectly random: \n\n\n\nP\n(\nh\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\nz\n\n1\n\n\n\u2227\nh\n(\ny\n)\n=\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n)\n=\n1\n\n/\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P(h(x)=z_{1}\\land h(y)=z_{2})=1/m^{2}}\n\n. Pairwise independence is sometimes called strong universality.\nAnother property is uniformity. We say that a family is uniform if all hash values are equally likely: \n\n\n\nP\n(\nh\n(\nx\n)\n=\nz\n)\n=\n1\n\n/\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P(h(x)=z)=1/m}\n\n for any hash value \n\n\n\nz\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z}\n\n. Universality does not imply uniformity. However, strong universality does imply uniformity.\nGiven a family with the uniform distance property, one can produce a pairwise independent or strongly universal hash family by adding a uniformly distributed random constant with values in \n\n\n\n[\nm\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [m]}\n\n to the hash functions. (Similarly, if \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n is a power of two, we can achieve pairwise independence from an XOR universal hash family by doing an exclusive or with a uniformly distributed random constant.) Since a shift by a constant is sometimes irrelevant in applications (e.g. hash tables), a careful distinction between the uniform distance property and pairwise independent is sometimes not made.[3]\nFor some applications (such as hash tables), it is important for the least significant bits of the hash values to be also universal. When a family is strongly universal, this is guaranteed: if \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n is a strongly universal family with \n\n\n\nm\n=\n\n2\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m=2^{L}}\n\n, then the family made of the functions \n\n\n\nh\n\nmod\n\n\n2\n\n\nL\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h{\\bmod {2^{L'}}}}\n\n for all \n\n\n\nh\n\u2208\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h\\in H}\n\n is also strongly universal for \n\n\n\n\nL\n\u2032\n\n\u2264\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L'\\leq L}\n\n. Unfortunately, the same is not true of (merely) universal families. For example, the family made of the identity function \n\n\n\nh\n(\nx\n)\n=\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h(x)=x}\n\n is clearly universal, but the family made of the function \n\n\n\nh\n(\nx\n)\n=\nx\n\nmod\n\n\n2\n\n\nL\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h(x)=x{\\bmod {2^{L'}}}}\n\n fails to be universal.\nUMAC and Poly1305-AES and several other message authentication code algorithms are based on universal hashing.[4][5] In such applications, the software chooses a new hash function for every message, based on a unique nonce for that message.\nSeveral hash table implementations are based on universal hashing. In such applications, typically the software chooses a new hash function only after it notices that \"too many\" keys have collided; until then, the same hash function continues to be used over and over. (Some collision resolution schemes, such as dynamic perfect hashing, pick a new hash function every time there is a collision. Other collision resolution schemes, such as cuckoo hashing and 2-choice hashing, allow a number of collisions before picking a new hash function). A survey of fastest known universal and strongly universal hash functions for integers, vectors, and strings is found in.[6]\nFor any fixed set \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n keys, using a universal family guarantees the following properties.\nAs the above guarantees hold for any fixed set \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n, they hold if the data set is chosen by an adversary. However, the adversary has to make this choice before (or independent of) the algorithm's random choice of a hash function. If the adversary can observe the random choice of the algorithm, randomness serves no purpose, and the situation is the same as deterministic hashing.\nThe second and third guarantee are typically used in conjunction with rehashing. For instance, a randomized algorithm may be prepared to handle some \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n)}\n\n number of collisions. If it observes too many collisions, it chooses another random \n\n\n\nh\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h}\n\n from the family and repeats. Universality guarantees that the number of repetitions is a geometric random variable.\nSince any computer data can be represented as one or more machine words, one generally needs hash functions for three types of domains: machine words (\"integers\"); fixed-length vectors of machine words; and variable-length vectors (\"strings\").\nThis section refers to the case of hashing integers that fit in machines words; thus, operations like multiplication, addition, division, etc. are cheap machine-level instructions. Let the universe to be hashed be \n\n\n\nU\n=\n{\n0\n,\n\u2026\n,\nm\n\u2212\n1\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle U=\\{0,\\dots ,m-1\\}}\n\n.\nThe original proposal of Carter and Wegman[1] was to pick a prime \n\n\n\np\n\u2265\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p\\geq m}\n\n and define\nwhere \n\n\n\na\n,\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a,b}\n\n are randomly chosen integers modulo \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n with \n\n\n\na\n\u2260\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a\\neq 0}\n\n. (This is a single iteration of a linear congruential generator.)\nTo see that \n\n\n\nH\n=\n{\n\nh\n\na\n,\nb\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H=\\{h_{a,b}\\}}\n\n is a universal family, note that \n\n\n\nh\n(\nx\n)\n=\nh\n(\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h(x)=h(y)}\n\n only holds when\nfor some integer \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n between \n\n\n\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0}\n\n and \n\n\n\n(\np\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n/\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (p-1)/m}\n\n. If \n\n\n\nx\n\u2260\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\neq y}\n\n, their difference, \n\n\n\nx\n\u2212\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x-y}\n\n is nonzero and has an inverse modulo \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n.

Thus the collision probability is\nAnother way to see \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n is a universal family is via the notion of statistical distance. Write the difference \n\n\n\nh\n(\nx\n)\n\u2212\nh\n(\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h(x)-h(y)}\n\n as\nSince \n\n\n\nx\n\u2212\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x-y}\n\n is nonzero and \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n is uniformly distributed in \n\n\n\n{\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\np\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{1,\\dots ,p\\}}\n\n, it follows that \n\n\n\na\n(\nx\n\u2212\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a(x-y)}\n\n modulo \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n is also uniformly distributed in \n\n\n\n{\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\np\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{1,\\dots ,p\\}}\n\n.

As a result, the statistical distance to a uniform family is \n\n\n\nO\n(\nm\n\n/\n\np\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(m/p)}\n\n, which becomes negligible when \n\n\n\np\n\u226b\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p\\gg m}\n\n.\nThe family of simpler hash functions\nis only approximately universal: \n\n\n\nPr\n{\n\nh\n\na\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\nh\n\na\n\n\n(\ny\n)\n}\n\u2264\n2\n\n/\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Pr\\{h_{a}(x)=h_{a}(y)\\}\\leq 2/m}\n\n for all \n\n\n\nx\n\u2260\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\neq y}\n\n.[1] Moreover, this analysis is nearly tight; Carter and Wegman [1] show that \n\n\n\nPr\n{\n\nh\n\na\n\n\n(\n1\n)\n=\n\nh\n\na\n\n\n(\nm\n+\n1\n)\n}\n\u2265\n2\n\n/\n\n(\nm\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Pr\\{h_{a}(1)=h_{a}(m+1)\\}\\geq 2/(m-1)}\n\n whenever \n\n\n\n(\np\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\u00a0\n\nmod\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nm\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (p-1)~{\\bmod {~}}m=1}\n\n.\nThe state of the art for hashing integers is the multiply-shift scheme described by Dietzfelbinger et al. in 1997.[8] By avoiding modular arithmetic, this method is much easier to implement and also runs significantly faster in practice (usually by at least a factor of four[9]). The scheme assumes the number of bins is a power of two, \n\n\n\nm\n=\n\n2\n\nM\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m=2^{M}}\n\n. Let \n\n\n\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w}\n\n be the number of bits in a machine word.

Then if the number of bins is \n\n\n\nm\n=\n\n2\n\nM\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m=2^{M}}\n\n for \n\n\n\nM\n\u2264\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M\\leq w}\n\n:\nIt is possible to halve the number of multiplications, which roughly translates to a two-fold speed-up in practice.[12] Initialize the hash function with a vector \n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\u00af\n\n\n\n=\n(\n\na\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\na\n\nk\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {a}}=(a_{0},\\dots ,a_{k-1})}\n\n of random odd integers on \n\n\n\n2\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2w}\n\n bits each. The following hash family is universal:[14]\nIf double-precision operations are not available, one can interpret the input as a vector of half-words (\n\n\n\nw\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w/2}\n\n-bit integers). The algorithm will then use \n\n\n\n\u2308\nk\n\n/\n\n2\n\u2309\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lceil k/2\\rceil }\n\n multiplications, where \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n was the number of half-words in the vector. Thus, the algorithm runs at a \"rate\" of one multiplication per word of input.\nThe same scheme can also be used for hashing integers, by interpreting their bits as vectors of bytes. In this variant, the vector technique is known as tabulation hashing and it provides a practical alternative to multiplication-based universal hashing schemes.[15]\nStrong universality at high speed is also possible.[16] Initialize the hash function with a vector \n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\u00af\n\n\n\n=\n(\n\na\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\na\n\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {a}}=(a_{0},\\dots ,a_{k})}\n\n of random integers on \n\n\n\n2\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2w}\n\n bits. Compute\nThe result is strongly universal on \n\n\n\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w}\n\n bits. Experimentally, it was found to run at 0.2 CPU cycle per byte on recent Intel processors for \n\n\n\nw\n=\n32\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w=32}\n\n.\nThis refers to hashing a variable-sized vector of machine words. If the length of the string can be bounded by a small number, it is best to use the vector solution from above (conceptually padding the vector with zeros up to the upper bound). The space required is the maximal length of the string, but the time to evaluate \n\n\n\nh\n(\ns\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h(s)}\n\n is just the length of \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n. As long as zeroes are forbidden in the string, the zero-padding can be ignored when evaluating the hash function without affecting universality[12]). Note that if zeroes are allowed in the string, then it might be best to append a fictitious non-zero (e.g., 1) character to all strings prior to padding: this will ensure that universality is not affected.[16]\nNow assume we want to hash \n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\u00af\n\n\n\n=\n(\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nx\n\n\u2113\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}=(x_{0},\\dots ,x_{\\ell })}\n\n, where a good bound on \n\n\n\n\u2113\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell }\n\n is not known a priori. A universal family proposed by [13] treats the string \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n as the coefficients of a polynomial modulo a large prime. If \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\u2208\n[\nu\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}\\in [u]}\n\n, let \n\n\n\np\n\u2265\nmax\n{\nu\n,\nm\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p\\geq \\max\\{u,m\\}}\n\n be a prime and define:\nUsing properties of modular arithmetic, above can be computed without producing large numbers for large strings as follows:[17]\nThis Rabin-Karp rolling hash is based on a linear congruential generator.[18] Above algorithm is also known as Multiplicative hash function.[19] In practice, the mod operator and the parameter p can be avoided altogether by simply allowing integer to overflow because it is equivalent to mod (Max-Int-Value + 1) in many programming languages. Below table shows values chosen to initialize h and a for some of the popular implementations.\nConsider two strings \n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\u00af\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\ny\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}},{\\bar {y}}}\n\n and let \n\n\n\n\u2113\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell }\n\n be length of the longer one; for the analysis, the shorter string is conceptually padded with zeros up to length \n\n\n\n\u2113\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell }\n\n. A collision before applying \n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\ni\nn\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h_{\\mathrm {int} }}\n\n implies that \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n is a root of the polynomial with coefficients \n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\ny\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}-{\\bar {y}}}\n\n. This polynomial has at most \n\n\n\n\u2113\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell }\n\n roots modulo \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n, so the collision probability is at most \n\n\n\n\u2113\n\n/\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell /p}\n\n. The probability of collision through the random \n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\ni\nn\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h_{\\mathrm {int} }}\n\n brings the total collision probability to \n\n\n\n\n\n1\nm\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2113\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{m}}+{\\frac {\\ell }{p}}}\n\n. Thus, if the prime \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n is sufficiently large compared to the length of strings hashed, the family is very close to universal (in statistical distance).\nOther universal families of hash functions used to hash unknown-length strings to fixed-length hash values include the Rabin fingerprint and the Buzhash.\nTo mitigate the computational penalty of modular arithmetic, two tricks are used in practice:[12]",
