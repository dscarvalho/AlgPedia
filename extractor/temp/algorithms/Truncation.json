This function ist used instead of\nfor a given number \n\n\n\nx\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\in \\mathbb {R} _{-}}\n\n.\nWith computers, truncation can occur when a decimal number is typecast as an integer; it is truncated to zero decimal digits because integers cannot store non-integer real numbers.\nAn analogue of truncation can be applied to polynomials. In this case, the truncation of a polynomial P to degree n can be defined as the sum of all terms of P of degree n or less. Polynomial truncations arise in the study of Taylor polynomials, for example.[1]",
