    "about": "A quantum sort is any sorting algorithm that runs on a quantum computer. Any comparison-based quantum sorting algorithm would take at least \n\n\n\n\u03a9\n(\nn\nlog\n\u2061\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Omega (n\\log n)}\n\n steps,[1] which is already achievable by classical algorithms. Thus, for this task, quantum computers are no better than classical ones. However, in space-bounded sorts, quantum algorithms outperform their classical counterparts.[2]",
