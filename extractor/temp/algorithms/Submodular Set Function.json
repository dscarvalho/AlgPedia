Submodular functions have a natural diminishing returns property which makes them suitable for many applications, including approximation algorithms, game theory (as functions modeling user preferences) and electrical networks. Recently, submodular functions have also found immense utility in several real world problems in machine learning and artificial intelligence, including automatic summarization, multi-document summarization, feature selection, active learning, sensor placement, image collection summarization and many other domains.[1][2][3][4]",

For this reason, an optimization problem which concerns optimizing a convex or concave function can also be described as the problem of maximizing or minimizing a submodular function subject to some constraints.\nThe simplest minimization problem is to find a set \n\n\n\nS\n\u2286\n\u03a9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S\\subseteq \\Omega }\n\n which minimizes a submodular function subject to no constraints. This problem is computable in (strongly)[8][9] polynomial time.[10][11] Computing the minimum cut in a graph is a special case of this general minimization problem. However, even simple constraints like cardinality lower bound constraints make this problem NP hard, with polynomial lower bound approximation factors.[12][13]\nUnlike minimization, maximization of submodular functions is usually NP-hard. Many problems, such as max cut and the maximum coverage problem, can be cast as special cases of this general maximization problem under suitable constraints. Typically, the approximation algorithms for these problems are based on either greedy algorithms or local search algorithms. The problem of maximizing a symmetric non-monotone submodular function subject to no constraints admits a 1/2 approximation algorithm.[14] Computing the maximum cut of a graph is a special case of this problem. The more general problem of maximizing an arbitrary non-monotone submodular function subject to no constraints also admits a 1/2 approximation algorithm.[15] The problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint admits a \n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n1\n\n/\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1-1/e}\n\n approximation algorithm.[16] The maximum coverage problem is a special case of this problem. The more general problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint also admits a \n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n1\n\n/\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1-1/e}\n\n approximation algorithm.[17][18] Many of these algorithms can be unified within a semi-differential based framework of algorithms.[13]\nApart from submodular minimization and maximization, another natural problem is Difference of Submodular Optimization.[19][20] Unfortunately, this problem is not only NP hard, but also inapproximable.[20] A related optimization problem is minimize or maximize a submodular function, subject to a submodular level set constraint (also called submodular optimization subject to submodular cover or submodular knapsack constraint). This problem admits bounded approximation guarantees.[21] Another optimization problem involves partitioning data based on a submodular function, so as to maximize the average welfare. This problem is called the submodular welfare problem.[22]\nSubmodular functions naturally occur in several real world applications, in economics, game theory, machine learning and computer vision. Owing the diminishing returns property, submodular functions naturally model costs of items, since there is often a larger discount, with an increase in the items one buys. Submodular functions model notions of complexity, similarity and cooperation when they appear in minimization problems. In maximization problems, on the other hand, they model notions of diversity, information and coverage.
