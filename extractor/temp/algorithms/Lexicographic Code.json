    "full_text": "Lexicographic codes or lexicodes are greedily generated error-correcting codes with remarkably good properties. They were produced independently by Levenshtein[1] and Conway and Sloane [2] and are known to be linear over some finite fields.\nA lexicode of minimum distance d and length n over a finite field is generated by starting with the all-zero vector and iteratively adding the next vector (in lexicographic order) of minimum Hamming distance d from the vectors added so far. As an example, the length-3 lexicode of minimum distance 2 would consist of the vectors marked by an \"X\" in the following example:\nSince lexicodes are linear, they can also be constructed by means of their basis.
