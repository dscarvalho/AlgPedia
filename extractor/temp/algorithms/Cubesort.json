    "full_text": "Cubesort is a parallel sorting algorithm that builds a self-balancing multi-dimensional array from the keys to be sorted. As the axes are of similar length the structure resembles a cube. After each key is inserted the cube can be rapidly converted to an array.[1]\nA cubesort implementation written in C was published in 2014.[2]\nCubesort's algorithm uses a specialized binary search on each axis to find the location to insert an element. When an axis grows too large it is split. Locality of reference is optimal as only 4 binary searches are performed on small arrays for each insertion. By using many small dynamic arrays the high cost for insertion on single large arrays is avoided.",
