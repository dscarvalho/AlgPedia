It is a generalization to the secant method for a multidimensional problem. This update maintains the symmetry of the matrix but does not guarantee that the update be positive definite.\nThe sequence of Hessian approximations generated by the SR1 method converges to the true Hessian under mild conditions, in theory; in practice, the approximate Hessians generated by the SR1 method show faster progress towards the true Hessian than do popular alternatives (BFGS or DFP), in preliminary numerical experiments.[1] The SR1 method has computational advantages for sparse or partially separable problems.\nA twice continuously differentiable function \n\n\n\nx\n\u21a6\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\mapsto f(x)}\n\n has a gradient (\n\n\n\n\u2207\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\nabla f}\n\n) and Hessian matrix \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n: The function \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n has an expansion as a Taylor series at \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{0}}\n\n, which can be truncated\nits gradient has a Taylor-series approximation also\nwhich is used to update \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n.
