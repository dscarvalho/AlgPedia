Because the number of complex exponentials must be known a priori, it is somewhat limited in its usefulness.\nPisarenko's method also assumes that \n\n\n\np\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p+1}\n\n values of the \n\n\n\nM\n\u00d7\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M\\times M}\n\n autocorrelation matrix are either known or estimated.

This eigenvector is orthogonal to each of the signal vectors.\nThe frequency estimates may be determined by setting the frequencies equal to the angles of the roots of the eigenfilter\nor the location of the peaks in the frequency estimation function\nwhere \n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} _{min}}\n\n is the noise eigenvector and\nVladilen Fedorovich Pisarenko originated this method in 1973 while examining the problem of estimating the frequencies of complex signals in white noise. He found that the frequencies could be derived from the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix.[2]",
