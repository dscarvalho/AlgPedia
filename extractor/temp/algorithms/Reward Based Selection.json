    "about": "Reward-based selection is a technique used in evolutionary algorithms for selecting potentially useful solutions for recombination. The probability of being selected for an individual is proportional to the cumulative reward, obtained by the individual. The cumulative reward can be computed as a sum of the individual reward and the reward, inherited from parents.",
