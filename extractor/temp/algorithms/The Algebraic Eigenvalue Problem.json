    "full_text": "James Hardy Wilkinson FRS[2] (27 September 1919 \u2013 5 October 1986) was a prominent figure in the field of numerical analysis, a field at the boundary of applied mathematics and computer science particularly useful to physics and engineering.[3][4][5]\n\n\nBorn in Strood, England, he attended the Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School in Rochester. He studied the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as Senior Wrangler.[6]\nTaking up war work in 1940, he began working on ballistics but transferred to the National Physical Laboratory[1] in 1946, where he worked with Alan Turing on the ACE[7] computer project. Later, Wilkinson's interests took him into the numerical analysis field, where he discovered many significant algorithms.\nWilkinson received the Turing Award in 1970 \"for his research in numerical analysis to facilitate the use of the high-speed digital computer, having received special recognition for his work in computations in linear algebra and 'backward' error analysis.\" In the same year, he also gave the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) John von Neumann Lecture.\nWilkinson also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1973.[8]\nThe J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software is named in his honour.\nWilkinson married Heather Ware in 1945. She and their son survived him, a daughter having predeceased him.",
