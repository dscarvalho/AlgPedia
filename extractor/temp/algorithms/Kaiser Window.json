    "full_text": "The Kaiser window, also known as the Kaiser\u2013Bessel window, was developed by James Kaiser at Bell Laboratories. It is a one-parameter family of window functions used for digital signal processing, and is defined by the formula[1][2]:\nwhere:\nWhen N is an odd number, the peak value of the window is \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nw\n[\n(\nN\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n]\n=\n1\n,\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle w[(N-1)/2]=1,}\n\n\u00a0 and when N is even, the peak values are \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nw\n[\nN\n\n/\n\n2\n\u2212\n1\n]\n\u00a0\n=\n\u00a0\nw\n[\nN\n\n/\n\n2\n]\n\u00a0\n<\n\u00a0\n1.\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle w[N/2-1]\\ =\\ w[N/2]\\ <\\ 1.}\n\n\n\n\nUnderlying the discrete sequence is this continuous-time function and its Fourier transform:\nThe maximum value of w0(t) is w0(0)\u00a0=\u00a01.\u00a0 The w[n] sequence defined above are the samples of:\nand where rect() is the rectangle function.\u00a0 The first null after the main lobe of W0(f) occurs at:\n\u03b1 controls the tradeoff between main-lobe width and side-lobe area.\u00a0 As \u03b1 increases, the main lobe of W0(f) increases in width, and the side lobes decrease in amplitude, as illustrated in the figure at right.\u00a0 \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00 corresponds to a rectangular window. For large \u03b1, the shape of the Kaiser window (in both time and frequency domain) tends to a Gaussian curve.\u00a0 The Kaiser window is nearly optimal in the sense of its peak's concentration around frequency 0 (Oppenheim et al., 1999).\nA related window function is the Kaiser\u2013Bessel-derived (KBD) window, which is designed to be suitable for use with the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). The KBD window function is defined in terms of the Kaiser window of length M+1, by the formula:\nThis defines a window of length 2M, where by construction dn satisfies the Princen-Bradley condition for the MDCT (using the fact that wM\u2212n = wn): dn2\u00a0+\u00a0dn\u00a0+\u00a0M2\u00a0=\u00a01 (interpreting n and n\u00a0+\u00a0M modulo 2M). The KBD window is also symmetric in the proper manner for the MDCT: dn\u00a0=\u00a0d2M\u22121\u2212n.\nThe KBD window is used in the Advanced Audio Coding digital audio format.",
