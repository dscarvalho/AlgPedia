    "full_text": "The ETX metric, or expected transmission count, is a measure of the quality of a path between two nodes in a wireless packet data network. It is used extensively in mesh networking algorithms.\nDouglas S.J. De Couto was the first to describe ETX in his 2004 doctoral dissertation at MIT.[1] Subsequently, it has been implemented in RoofNet/Meraki and OLSR mesh networking protocols, among others.\nETX is the number of expected transmissions of a packet necessary for it to be received without error at its destination. This number varies from one to infinity. An ETX of one indicates a perfect transmission medium, where an ETX of infinity represents a completely non-functional link. Note that ETX is an expected transmission count for a future event, as opposed to an actual count of a past event. It is hence a real number, and not an integer. For example, if it took 1898 transmissions to transfer 1024 packets without error, the ETX on the link is 1898/1024, or approximately 1.85. Due to varying characteristics of the transmission medium, the number may vary widely.\nIt is often useful to convert between ETX and the packet error probability \n\n\n\n\ne\n\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e_{pt}}\n\n:\n\n\n\n\n\nE\nT\nX\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\u2212\n\ne\n\np\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {ETX} ={\\frac {1}{1-e_{pt}}}}\n\n",
