    "full_text": "Instantaneous phase and instantaneous frequency are important concepts in signal processing that occur in the context of the representation and analysis of time-varying functions. The instantaneous phase (or \"local phase\" or simply \"phase\") of a complex-valued function s(t), is the real-valued function:\nwhere arg is the argument function.\nAnd for a real-valued function s(t), it is determined from the function's analytic representation, sa(t):[1]\nWhen \u03c6(t) is constrained to its principal value, either the interval (-\u03c0, \u03c0] or [0, 2\u03c0), it is called wrapped phase. Otherwise it is called unwrapped phase, which is a continuous function of argument t, assuming sa(t) is a continuous function of t. Unless otherwise indicated, the continuous form should be inferred.\n\n\nwhere \u03c9 > 0.\nIn this simple sinusoidal example, the constant \u03b8 is also commonly referred to as phase or phase offset. \u03c6(t) is a function of time; \u03b8 is not. In the next example, we also see that the phase offset of a real-valued sinusoid is ambiguous unless a reference (sin or cos) is specified. \u03c6(t) is unambiguously defined.\nwhere \u03c9 > 0.\nIn both examples the local maxima of s(t) correspond to \u03c6(t) = 2\u03c0N for integer values of N. This has applications in the field of computer vision.\nInstantaneous angular frequency is defined as:\nand instantaneous (ordinary) frequency is defined as:\nThe inverse operation is:\nFor discrete-time functions, this can be written as a recursion:\nDiscontinuities can then be removed by adding 2\u03c0 whenever \u0394\u03c6(nT) \u2264 \u2212\u03c0, and subtracting 2\u03c0 whenever \u0394\u03c6(nT) > \u03c0. That allows \u03c6(nT) to accumulate without limit and produces an unwrapped instantaneous phase. An equivalent formulation that replaces the modulo 2\u03c0 operation with a complex multiplication is:\nwhere the asterisk denotes complex conjugate.\nIn some applications, such as averaging the values of phase at several moments of time, it may be useful to convert each value to a complex number, or vector representation:[2]\nThis representation is similar to the wrapped phase representation in that it does not distinguish between multiples of 2\u03c0 in the phase, but similar to the unwrapped phase representation since it is continuous. A vector-average phase can be obtained as the arg of the sum of the complex numbers without concern about wrap-around.",
