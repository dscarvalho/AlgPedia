    "full_text": "The paper is a joint work by Martin Dyer, Alan M. Frieze and Ravindran Kannan.[1]\nThe main result of the paper is a randomized algorithm for finding an \n\n\n\n\u03f5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\epsilon }\n\n approximation to the volume of a convex body \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n in \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional Euclidean space by assuming the existence of a membership oracle. The algorithm takes time bounded by a polynomial in \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n, the dimension of \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n and \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\n\u03f5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/\\epsilon }\n\n.\nThe algorithm is a sophisticated usage of the so-called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The basic scheme of the algorithm is a nearly uniform sampling from within \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n by placing a grid consisting \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional cubes and doing a random walk over these cubes. By using the theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains, they show that it takes a polynomial time for the random walk to settle down to being a nearly uniform distribution.",
