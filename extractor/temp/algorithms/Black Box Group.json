    "full_text": "In computational group theory, a black box group (black-box group) is a group G whose elements are encoded by bit strings of length N, and group operations are performed by an oracle (the \"black box\"). These operations include:\n\u2022 taking a product g\u00b7h of elements g and h,\n\u2022 taking an inverse g\u22121 of element g,\n\u2022 deciding whether g\u00a0=\u00a01.\nThis class is defined to include both the permutation groups and the matrix groups. The upper bound on the order of G given by |G|\u00a0\u2264\u00a02N shows that G is finite.\n\n\nThe black box groups were introduced by Babai and Szemer\u00e9di in 1984. They were used as a formalism for (constructive) group recognition and property testing. Notable algorithms include the Babai's algorithm for finding random group elements,[1] the Product Replacement Algorithm,[2] and testing group commutativity.[3]\nMany early algorithms in CGT, such as the Schreier\u2013Sims algorithm, require a permutation representation of a group and thus are not black box. Many other algorithms require finding element orders. Since there are efficient ways of finding the order of an element in a permutation group or in a matrix group (a method for the latter is described by Celler and Leedham-Green in 1997), a common recourse is to assume that the black box group is equipped with a further oracle for determining element orders.[4]",
