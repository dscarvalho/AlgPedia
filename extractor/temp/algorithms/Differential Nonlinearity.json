    "about": "Differential nonlinearity (acronym DNL) is a term describing the deviation between two analog values corresponding to adjacent input digital values. It is an important specification for measuring error in a digital-to-analog converter (DAC); the accuracy of a DAC is mainly determined by this specification. Ideally, any two adjacent digital codes correspond to output analog voltages that are exactly one Least Significant Bit (LSB) apart. Differential non-linearity is a measure of the worst case deviation from the ideal 1 LSB step. For example, a DAC with a 1.5 LSB output change for a 1 LSB digital code change exhibits 1\u20442 LSB differential non-linearity. Differential non-linearity may be expressed in fractional bits or as a percentage of full scale. A differential non-linearity greater than 1 LSB may lead to a non-monotonic transfer function in a DAC.[1] It is also known as a missing code.",

For transducers if a change in the input produces a uniform step change in the output the tranducer possess differential linearity. Differential linearity is desirable and is inherent to a system such as a single-slope analog-to-digital converter used in nuclear instrumentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDNL(i)\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nout\n\n\n(\ni\n+\n1\n)\n\u2212\n\nV\n\nout\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\nideal LSB step width\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{DNL(i)}}={{V_{\\text{out}}(i+1)-V_{\\text{out}}(i)} \\over {\\text{ideal LSB step width}}}-1}\n\n\n",
