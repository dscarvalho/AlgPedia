It can be proven that if \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n=\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{0}=n}\n\n is chosen as the initial guess, one can stop as soon as\nto ensure that \n\n\n\n\u230a\n\nx\n\nk\n+\n1\n\n\n\u230b\n=\n\u230a\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u230b\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lfloor x_{k+1}\\rfloor =\\lfloor {\\sqrt {n}}\\rfloor .}\n\n\nFor computing \n\n\n\n\u230a\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u230b\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lfloor {\\sqrt {n}}\\rfloor }\n\n for very large integers n, one can use the quotient of Euclidean division for both of the division operations. This has the advantage of only using integers for each intermediate value, thus making the use of floating point representations of large numbers unnecessary. It is equivalent to using the iterative formula\nBy using the fact that\none can show that this will reach \n\n\n\n\u230a\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u230b\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lfloor {\\sqrt {n}}\\rfloor }\n\n within a finite number of iterations.\nHowever, \n\n\n\n\u230a\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u230b\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lfloor {\\sqrt {n}}\\rfloor }\n\n is not necessarily a fixed point of the above iterative formula. Indeed, it can be shown that \n\n\n\n\u230a\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u230b\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lfloor {\\sqrt {n}}\\rfloor }\n\n is a fixed point if and only if \n\n\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n+1}\n\n is not a perfect square. If \n\n\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n+1}\n\n is a perfect square, the sequence ends up in a period-two cycle between \n\n\n\n\u230a\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u230b\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lfloor {\\sqrt {n}}\\rfloor }\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u230a\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u230b\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lfloor {\\sqrt {n}}\\rfloor +1}\n\n instead of converging.\nAlthough \n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {n}}}\n\n is irrational for many \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n, the sequence \n\n\n\n{\n\nx\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{x_{k}\\}}\n\n contains only rational terms when \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{0}}\n\n is rational. Thus, with this method it is unnecessary to exit the field of rational numbers in order to calculate \n\n\n\n\nisqrt\n\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mbox{isqrt}}(n)}\n\n, a fact which has some theoretical advantages.\nOne can prove that \n\n\n\nc\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c=1}\n\n is the largest possible number for which the stopping criterion\nensures \n\n\n\n\u230a\n\nx\n\nk\n+\n1\n\n\n\u230b\n=\n\u230a\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u230b\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lfloor x_{k+1}\\rfloor =\\lfloor {\\sqrt {n}}\\rfloor }\n\n in the algorithm above.\nIn implementations which use number formats that cannot represent all rational numbers exactly (for example, floating point), a stopping constant less than one should be used to protect against roundoff errors.",
