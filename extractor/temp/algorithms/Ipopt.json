IPOPT can be called from various modeling environments and C.\nIPOPT is part of the COIN-OR project.\nIPOPT is designed to exploit 1st and 2nd derivative (Hessians) information if provided (usually via automatic differentiation routines in modeling environments such as AMPL). If no Hessians are provided, IPOPT will approximate them using a quasi-Newton methods, specifically a BFGS update.\nIt was originally developed by Andreas W\u00e4chter, a former Ph.D. student in department of chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, under the supervision of Lorenz T. Biegler.\nArvind Raghunathan later created an extension to IPOPT for Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) [1]. This version of IPOPT is generally known as IPOPT-C (with the 'C' standing for 'complementarity'). While in theory any mixed-integer program can be recast as an MPEC, it may or may not be solvable with IPOPT-C. Solution of MINLPs (Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programs) using IPOPT is still being explored [2] [3].\nCarl Laird and Andreas W\u00e4chter are the developers of IPOPT 3.0, which is a re-implementation of IPOPT in C++.\n",
