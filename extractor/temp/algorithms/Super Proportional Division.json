    "full_text": "In the context of fair cake-cutting, a super-proportional division is a division in which each partner receives strictly more than 1/n of the resource by their own subjective valuation (\n\n\n\nV\n>\n1\n\n/\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V>1/n}\n\n).\nA super-proportional division is better than a proportional division, in which each partner is guaranteed to receive at least 1/n (\n\n\n\nV\n\u2265\n1\n\n/\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V\\geq 1/n}\n\n). However, in contrast to proportional division, a super-proportional division does not always exist. When all partners have exactly the same value functions, the best we can do is give each partner exactly 1/n.\nA necessary condition for the existence of a super-proportional division is, therefore, that not all partners have the same value measure.\nA surprising fact is that, when the valuations are additive and non-atomic, this condition is also sufficient. I.e., when there are at least two partners whose value function is even slightly different, then there is a super-proportional division in which all partners receive more than 1/n.\n\n\nThe existence of a super-proportional division was first conjectured as early as 1948:[1]\nThe first published proof to the existence of super-proportional division was as a corollary to the Dubins\u2013Spanier convexity theorem. This was a purely existential proof based on convexity arguments.\nA protocol for finding a super-proportional division was presented in 1986.[2]\nLet C be the entire cake. The protocol starts with a specific piece of cake, say X \u2286 C, which is valued differently by two partners. Call these partners Alice and Bob.\nLet a=VAlice(X) and b=VBob(X) and assume w.l.o.g. that b>a.\nFind a rational number between b and a, say p/q such that b > p/q > a. Ask Bob to divide X to p equal parts and divide C \\ X to q-p equal parts.\nBy our assumptions, Bob values each piece of X as more than 1/q and each piece of C \\ X as less than 1/q. But for Alice, at least one piece of X (say, Y) must have a value of less than 1/q and at least one piece of C\\X (say, Z) must have a value of more than 1/q.\nSo now we have two pieces, Y and Z, such that:\nLet Alice and Bob divide the remainder C \\ Y \\ Z between them in a proportional manner (e.g. using divide and choose). Add Z to the piece of Alice and add Y to the piece of Bob.\nNow each partner thinks that his/her allocation is strictly better than the other allocation, so its value is strictly more than 1/2.\nThe extension of this protocol to n partners is based on Fink's \"Lone Chooser\" protocol.\nSuppose we already have a super-proportional division to i-1 partners (for i\u22653). Now partner #i enters the party and we should give him a small piece from each of the first i-1 partners, such that the new division is still super-proportional.\nConsider e.g. partner #1. Let d be the difference between partner #1's current value and (1/(i-1)). Because the current division is super-proportional, we know that d>0.\nChoose a positive integer q such that: \n\n\n\nd\n>\n\n\n1\n\n(\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\ni\n(\nq\n(\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d>{\\frac {1}{(i-1)i(q(i-1)-1)}}}\n\n\nAsk partner #1 to divide his share to \n\n\n\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle qi-1}\n\n pieces which he considers of equal value and let the new partner choose the \n\n\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\n pieces which he considers to be the most valuable.\nPartner #1 remains with a value of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\u2212\nq\n\n\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nq\n(\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\u2212\n1\n\n\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {(qi-1)-q}{qi-1}}={\\frac {q(i-1)-1}{qi-1}}}\n\n of his previous value, which was \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n+\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{i-1}}+d}\n\n (by definition of d). The first element becomes \n\n\n\n\n\n\nq\n(\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n(\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n(\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {q(i-1)-1}{(i-1)(qi-1)}}}\n\n and the d becomes \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\ni\n(\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n(\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{i(i-1)(qi-1)}}}\n\n; summing them up gives that the new value is more than: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n(\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n(\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\ni\n(\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {(qi-1)(i-1)}{(i-1)i(qi-1)}}={\\frac {1}{i}}}\n\n of the entire cake.\nAs for the new partner, after having taken q pieces from each of the first i-1 partners, his total value is at least: \n\n\n\n\n\nq\n\nq\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n>\n\n\n1\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {q}{qi-1}}>{\\frac {1}{i}}}\n\n of the entire cake.\nThis proves that the new division is also super-proportional.",
