    "full_text": "Spectral flatness or tonality coefficient,[1][2] also known as Wiener entropy,[3][4] is a measure used in digital signal processing to characterize an audio spectrum. Spectral flatness is typically measured in decibels, and provides a way to quantify how noise-like a sound is, as opposed to being tone-like.[2]\nThe meaning of tonal in this context is in the sense of the amount of peaks or resonant structure in a power spectrum, as opposed to flat spectrum of a white noise. A high spectral flatness (approaching 1.0 for white noise) indicates that the spectrum has a similar amount of power in all spectral bands \u2014 this would sound similar to white noise, and the graph of the spectrum would appear relatively flat and smooth. A low spectral flatness (approaching 0.0 for a pure tone) indicates that the spectral power is concentrated in a relatively small number of bands \u2014 this would typically sound like a mixture of sine waves, and the spectrum would appear \"spiky\".[5]\nThe spectral flatness is calculated by dividing the geometric mean of the power spectrum by the arithmetic mean of the power spectrum, i.e.:\nwhere x(n) represents the magnitude of bin number n. Note that a single (or more) empty bin yields a flatness of 0, so this measure is most useful when bins are generally not empty.\nThe ratio produced by this calculation is often converted to a decibel scale for reporting, with a maximum of 0\u00a0dB and a minimum of \u2212\u221e dB.\nThe spectral flatness can also be measured within a specified subband, rather than across the whole band.\nThis measurement is one of the many audio descriptors used in the MPEG-7 standard, in which it is labelled \"AudioSpectralFlatness\".\nIn birdsong research, it has been used as one of the features measured on birdsong audio, when testing similarity between two excerpts.[6]",
