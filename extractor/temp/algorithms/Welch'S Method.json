    "about": "In physics, engineering, and applied mathematics, Welch's method, named after P.D. Welch, is used for estimating the power of a signal at different frequencies: that is, it is an approach to spectral density estimation. The method is based on the concept of using periodogram spectrum estimates, which are the result of converting a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Welch's method is an improvement on the standard periodogram spectrum estimating method and on Bartlett's method, in that it reduces noise in the estimated power spectra in exchange for reducing the frequency resolution. Due to the noise caused by imperfect and finite data, the noise reduction from Welch's method is often desired.",

The individual periodograms are then averaged, which reduces the variance of the individual power measurements. The end result is an array of power measurements vs. frequency \"bin\".\nOther overlapping windowed Fourier transforms include:",
