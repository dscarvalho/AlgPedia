An estimate is suitable if replacing it with the unknown parameter does not cause major damage in next computations. In Algorithmic inference, suitability of an estimate reads in terms of compatibility with the observed sample.\nIn this framework, resampling methods are aimed at generating a set of candidate values to replace the unknown parameters that we read as compatible replicas of them. They represent a population of specifications of a random vector \n\n\n\n\n\u0398\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\Theta }}}\n\n [1] compatible with an observed sample, where the compatibility of its values has the properties of a probability distribution. By plugging parameters into the expression of the questioned distribution law, we bootstrap entire populations of random variables compatible with the observed sample.\nThe rationale of the algorithms computing the replicas, which we denote population bootstrap procedures, is to identify a set of statistics \n\n\n\n{\n\ns\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\ns\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{s_{1},\\ldots ,s_{k}\\}}\n\n exhibiting specific properties, denoting a well behavior, w.r.t. the unknown parameters. The statistics are expressed as functions of the observed values \n\n\n\n{\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nx\n\nm\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{m}\\}}\n\n, by definition. The \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n\n may be expressed as a function of the unknown parameters and a random seed specification \n\n\n\n\nz\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z_{i}}\n\n through the sampling mechanism \n\n\n\n(\n\ng\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n,\nZ\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (g_{\\boldsymbol {\\theta }},Z)}\n\n, in turn. Then, by plugging the second expression in the former, we obtain \n\n\n\n\ns\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s_{j}}\n\n expressions as functions of seeds and parameters \u2013 the master equations \u2013 that we invert to find values of the latter as a function of: i) the statistics, whose values in turn are fixed at the observed ones; and ii) the seeds, which are random according to their own distribution. Hence from a set of seed samples we obtain a set of parameter replicas.\n\n\nGiven a \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n=\n{\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nx\n\nm\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {x}}=\\{x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{m}\\}}\n\n of a random variable X and a sampling mechanism \n\n\n\n(\n\ng\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n,\nZ\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (g_{\\boldsymbol {\\theta }},Z)}\n\n for X, the realization x is given by \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n=\n{\n\ng\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n(\n\nz\n\n1\n\n\n)\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\ng\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n(\n\nz\n\nm\n\n\n)\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {x}}=\\{g_{\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}(z_{1}),\\ldots ,g_{\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}(z_{m})\\}}\n\n, with \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\n(\n\n\u03b8\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\n\u03b8\n\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}=(\\theta _{1},\\ldots ,\\theta _{k})}\n\n.

Instead, it is a function of the number of seeds we draw. In turn, this number is purely a matter of computational time but does not require any extension of the observed data. With other bootstrapping methods focusing on a generation of sample replicas (like those proposed by (Efron and Tibshirani 1993)) the accuracy of the estimate distributions depends on the sample size.\nFor \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {x}}}\n\n expected to represent a Pareto distribution, whose specification requires values for the parameters \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n and k,[2] we have that the cumulative distribution function reads:\nA sampling mechanism \n\n\n\n(\n\ng\n\n(\na\n,\nk\n)\n\n\n,\nU\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (g_{(a,k)},U)}\n\n has \n\n\n\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [0,1]}\n\n uniform seed U and explaining function \n\n\n\n\ng\n\n(\na\n,\nk\n)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g_{(a,k)}}\n\n described by:\nA relevant statistic \n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\u0398\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {s}}_{\\boldsymbol {\\Theta }}}\n\n is constituted by the pair of joint sufficient statistics for \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n and K, respectively \n\n\n\n\ns\n\n1\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nm\n\n\nlog\n\u2061\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n,\n\ns\n\n2\n\n\n=\nmin\n{\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s_{1}=\\sum _{i=1}^{m}\\log x_{i},s_{2}=\\min\\{x_{i}\\}}\n\n.
