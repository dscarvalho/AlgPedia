The Whitney constant \n\n\n\nW\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W(k)}\n\n is the smallest value of \n\n\n\n\nW\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W_{k}}\n\n for which the above inequality holds. The theorem is particularly useful when applied on intervals of small length, leading to good estimates on the error of spline approximation.\nThe original proof given by Whitney follows an analytic argument which utilizes the properties of moduli of smoothness. However, it can also be proved in a much shorter way using Peetre's K-functionals.[3]\nLet:\nwhere \n\n\n\nL\n(\nx\n;\nF\n;\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nx\n\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L(x;F;x_{0},\\ldots ,x_{k})}\n\n is the Lagrange polynomial for \n\n\n\nF\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F}\n\n at the nodes \n\n\n\n{\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nx\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{x_{0},\\ldots ,x_{k}\\}}\n\n.\nNow fix some \n\n\n\nx\n\u2208\n[\na\n,\nb\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\in [a,b]}\n\n and choose \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\delta }\n\n for which \n\n\n\n(\nx\n+\nk\n\u03b4\n)\n\u2208\n[\na\n,\nb\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (x+k\\delta )\\in [a,b]}\n\n. Then:\nTherefore:\nAnd since we have \n\n\n\n\u2225\nG\n\n\u2225\n\nC\n(\n[\na\n,\nb\n]\n)\n\n\n\u2264\nh\n\n\u03c9\n\nk\n\n\n(\nh\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\|G\\|_{C([a,b])}\\leq h\\omega _{k}(h)}\n\n, (a property of moduli of smoothness)\nSince \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\delta }\n\n can always be chosen in such a way that \n\n\n\nh\n\u2265\n\n|\n\n\u03b4\n\n|\n\n\u2265\nh\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h\\geq |\\delta |\\geq h/2}\n\n, this completes the proof.\nIt is important to have sharp estimates of the Whitney constants. It is easily shown that \n\n\n\nW\n(\n1\n)\n=\n1\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W(1)=1/2}\n\n, and it was first proved by Burkill (1952) that \n\n\n\nW\n(\n2\n)\n\u2264\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W(2)\\leq 1}\n\n, who conjectured that \n\n\n\nW\n(\nk\n)\n\u2264\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W(k)\\leq 1}\n\n for all \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n. Whitney was also able to prove that [2]\nand\nIn 1964, Brudnyi was able to obtain the estimate \n\n\n\nW\n(\nk\n)\n=\nO\n(\n\nk\n\n2\nk\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W(k)=O(k^{2k})}\n\n, and in 1982, Sendov proved that \n\n\n\nW\n(\nk\n)\n\u2264\n(\nk\n+\n1\n)\n\nk\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W(k)\\leq (k+1)k^{k}}\n\n. Then, in 1985, Ivanov and Takev proved that \n\n\n\nW\n(\nk\n)\n=\nO\n(\nk\nln\n\u2061\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W(k)=O(k\\ln k)}\n\n, and Binev proved that \n\n\n\nW\n(\nk\n)\n=\nO\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W(k)=O(k)}\n\n.
