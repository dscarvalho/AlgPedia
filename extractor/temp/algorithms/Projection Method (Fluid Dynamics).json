It was originally introduced by Alexandre Chorin in 1967 [1] [2] as an efficient means of solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The key advantage of the projection method is that the computations of the velocity and the pressure fields are decoupled.\n\n\nThe algorithm of projection method is based on the Helmholtz decomposition (sometimes called Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition) of any vector field into a solenoidal part and an irrotational part. Typically, the algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, an intermediate velocity that does not satisfy the incompressibility constraint is computed at each time step. In the second, the pressure is used to project the intermediate velocity onto a space of divergence-free velocity field to get the next update of velocity and pressure.\nThe theoretical background of projection type method is the decomposition theorem of Ladyzhenskaya sometimes referred to as Helmholtz\u2013Hodge Decomposition or simply as Hodge decomposition. It states that the vector field \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} }\n\n defined on a simply connected domain can be uniquely decomposed into a divergence-free (solenoidal) part \n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nsol\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} _{\\text{sol}}}\n\n and an irrotational part \n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nirrot\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} _{\\text{irrot}}}\n\n. .[3]\nThus,\nsince \n\n\n\n\u2207\n\u00d7\n\u2207\n\u03d5\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\nabla \\times \\nabla \\phi =0}\n\n for some scalar function, \n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,\\phi }\n\n. Taking the divergence of equation yields\nThis is a Poisson equation for the scalar function \n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,\\phi }\n\n. If the vector field \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} }\n\n is known, the above equation can be solved for the scalar function \n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,\\phi }\n\n and the divergence-free part of \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} }\n\n can be extracted using the relation\nThis is the essence of solenoidal projection method for solving incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equation (differential form of momentum equation) may be written as\nIn Chorin's original version of the projection method, one first computes an intermediate velocity, \n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} ^{*}}\n\n, explicitly using the momentum equation by ignoring the pressure gradient term:\nwhere \n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} ^{n}}\n\n is the velocity at \n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,n}\n\nth time step. In the second half of the algorithm, the projection step, we correct the intermediate velocity to obtain the final solution of the time step \n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} ^{n+1}}\n\n:\nOne can rewrite this equation in the form of a time step as\nto make clear that the algorithm is really just an operator splitting approach in which one considers the viscous forces (in the first half step) and the pressure forces (in the second half step) separately.\nComputing the right-hand side of the second half step requires knowledge of the pressure, \n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,p}\n\n, at the\n\n\n\n\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,(n+1)}\n\n time level. This is obtained by taking the divergence and requiring that \n\n\n\n\u2207\n\u22c5\n\n\nu\n\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {u} ^{n+1}=0}\n\n, which is the divergence (continuity) condition, thereby deriving the following Poisson equation for \n\n\n\n\n\np\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,p^{n+1}}\n\n,\nIt is instructive to note that the equation written as\nis the standard Hodge decomposition if boundary condition for \n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,p}\n\n on the domain boundary, \n\n\n\n\u2202\n\u03a9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\partial \\Omega }\n\n are \n\n\n\n\u2207\n\np\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n\u22c5\n\nn\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\nabla p^{n+1}\\cdot \\mathbf {n} =0}\n\n. In practice, this condition is responsible for the errors this method shows close to the boundary of the domain since the real pressure (i.e., the pressure in the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations) does not satisfy such boundary conditions.\nFor the explicit method, the boundary condition for \n\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} ^{*}}\n\n in equation (1) is natural.
