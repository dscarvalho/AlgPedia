It was the dominant algorithm for solving the problem until the Cantor\u2013Zassenhaus algorithm of 1981. It is currently implemented in many well-known computer algebra systems.\n\n\nBerlekamp's algorithm takes as input a square-free polynomial \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n (i.e. one with no repeated factors) of degree \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n with coefficients in a finite field \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q}}\n\n and gives as output a polynomial \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)}\n\n with coefficients in the same field such that \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)}\n\n divides \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n. The algorithm may then be applied recursively to these and subsequent divisors, until we find the decomposition of \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n into powers of irreducible polynomials (recalling that the ring of polynomials over a finite field is a unique factorization domain).\nAll possible factors of \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n are contained within the factor ring\nThe algorithm focuses on polynomials \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\u2208\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)\\in R}\n\n which satisfy the congruence:\nThese polynomials form a subalgebra of R (which can be considered as an \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional vector space over \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q}}\n\n), called the Berlekamp subalgebra. The Berlekamp subalgebra is of interest because the polynomials \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)}\n\n it contains satisfy\nIn general, not every GCD in the above product will be a non-trivial factor of \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n, but some are, providing the factors we seek.\nBerlekamp's algorithm finds polynomials \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)}\n\n suitable for use with the above result by computing a basis for the Berlekamp subalgebra. This is achieved via the observation that Berlekamp subalgebra is in fact the kernel of a certain \n\n\n\nn\n\u00d7\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\times n}\n\n matrix over \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q}}\n\n, which is derived from the so-called Berlekamp matrix of the polynomial, denoted \n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {Q}}}\n\n. If \n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n=\n[\n\nq\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {Q}}=[q_{i,j}]}\n\n then \n\n\n\n\nq\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q_{i,j}}\n\n is the coefficient of the \n\n\n\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle j}\n\n-th power term in the reduction of \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\nq\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{iq}}\n\n modulo \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n, i.e.:\nWith a certain polynomial \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\u2208\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)\\in R}\n\n, say:\nwe may associate the row vector:\nIt is relatively straightforward to see that the row vector \n\n\n\ng\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g{\\mathcal {Q}}}\n\n corresponds, in the same way, to the reduction of \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n\n)\n\nq\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)^{q}}\n\n modulo \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n. Consequently a polynomial \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\u2208\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)\\in R}\n\n is in the Berlekamp subalgebra if and only if \n\n\n\ng\n(\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\u2212\nI\n)\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g({\\mathcal {Q}}-I)=0}\n\n (where \n\n\n\nI\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I}\n\n is the \n\n\n\nn\n\u00d7\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\times n}\n\n identity matrix), i.e. if and only if it is in the null space of \n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\u2212\nI\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {Q}}-I}\n\n.\nBy computing the matrix \n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\u2212\nI\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {Q}}-I}\n\n and reducing it to reduced row echelon form and then easily reading off a basis for the null space, we may find a basis for the Berlekamp subalgebra and hence construct polynomials \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)}\n\n in it. We then need to successively compute GCDs of the form above until we find a non-trivial factor. Since the ring of polynomials over a field is a Euclidean domain, we may compute these GCDs using the Euclidean algorithm.\nOne important application of Berlekamp's algorithm is in computing discrete logarithms over finite fields \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\np\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{p^{n}}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n is prime and \n\n\n\nn\n\u2265\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\geq 2}\n\n. Computing discrete logarithms is an important problem in public key cryptography and error-control coding. For a finite field, the fastest known method is the index calculus method, which involves the factorisation of field elements. If we represent the field \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\np\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{p^{n}}}\n\n in the usual way - that is, as polynomials over the base field \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{p}}\n\n, reduced modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n - then this is simply polynomial factorisation, as provided by Berlekamp's algorithm.\nBerlekamp's algorithm may be accessed in the PARI/GP package using the factormod command, and the WolframAlpha [1] website.",
