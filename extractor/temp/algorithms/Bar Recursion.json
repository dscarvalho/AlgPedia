    "full_text": "Bar recursion is a generalized form of recursion developed by C. Spector in his 1962 paper.[1] It is related to bar induction in the same fashion that primitive recursion is related to ordinary induction, or transfinite recursion is related to transfinite induction.\nLet V, R, and O be types, and i be any natural number, representing a sequence of parameters taken from V. Then the function sequence f of functions fn from Vi+n \u2192 R to O is defined by bar recursion from the functions Ln\u00a0: R \u2192 O and B with Bn\u00a0: ((Vi+n \u2192 R) x (Vn \u2192 R)) \u2192 O if:\nHere \"cat\" is the concatenation function, sending p, x to the sequence which starts with p, and has x as its last term.\n(This definition is based on the one by Escard\u00f3 and Oliva.[2])\nProvided that for every sufficiently long function (\u03bb\u03b1)r of type Vi \u2192 R, there is some n with Ln(r) = Bn((\u03bb\u03b1)r, (\u03bbx:V)Ln+1(r)), the bar induction rule ensures that f is well-defined.\nThe idea is that one extends the sequence arbitrarily, using the recursion term B to determine the effect, until a sufficiently long node of the tree of sequences over V is reached; then the base term L determines the final value of f. The well-definedness condition corresponds to the requirement that every infinite path must eventually pass though a sufficiently long node: the same requirement that is needed to invoke a bar induction.\nThe principles of bar induction and bar recursion are the intuitionistic equivalents of the axiom of dependent choices.[3]",
