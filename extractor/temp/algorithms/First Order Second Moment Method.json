As \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n is randomly distributed, also \n\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g}\n\n is randomly distributed.

Considering also the second-order terms of the Taylor expansion, the approximation of the mean value is given by\nThe second-order approximation of the variance is given by\nThe skewness of \n\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g}\n\n can be determined from the third central moment \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\ng\n,\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{g,3}}\n\n. When considering only linear terms of the Taylor series, but higher-order moments, the third central moment is approximated by\nFor the second-order approximations of the third central moment as well as for the derivation of all higher-order approximations see Appendix D of Ref.[2] Taking into account the quadratic terms of the Taylor series and the third moments of the input variables is referred to as second-order third-moment method.[3] However, the full second-order approach of the variance (given above) also includes fourth-order moments of input parameters, and the full second-order approach of the skewness 6th-order moments [2]\nThere are several examples in the literature where the FOSM method is employed to estimate the stochastic distribution of the buckling load of axially compressed structures (see e.g. Ref.[4][5][6][7]). For structures which are very sensitive to deviations from the ideal structure (like cylindrical shells) it has been proposed to use the FOSM method as a design approach. Often the applicability is checked by comparison with a Monte Carlo simulation. In engineering practice, the objective function often is not given as analytic expression, but for instance as a result of a finite-element simulation. Then the derivatives of the objective function need to be estimated by the central differences method. The number of evaluations of the objective function equals \n\n\n\n2\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2n+1}\n\n. Depending on the number of random variables this still can mean a significantly smaller number of evaluations than performing a Monte Carlo simulation. However, when using the FOSM method as a design procedure, a lower bound shall be estimated, which is actually not given by the FOSM approach. Therefore, a type of distribution needs to be assumed for the distribution of the objective function, taking into account the approximated mean value and standard deviation.",
