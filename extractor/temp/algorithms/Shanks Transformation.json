This method is named after Daniel Shanks, who rediscovered this sequence transformation in 1955. It was first derived and published by R. Schmidt in 1941.[1]\nOne can calculate only a few terms of a perturbation expansion, usually no more than two or three, and almost never more than seven. The resulting series is often slowly convergent, or even divergent. Yet those few terms contain a remarkable amount of information, which the investigator should do his best to extract.\nThis viewpoint has been persuasively set forth in a delightful paper by Shanks (1955), who displays a number of amazing examples, including several from fluid mechanics.\n\n\nFor a sequence \n\n\n\n\n\n{\n\na\n\nm\n\n\n}\n\n\nm\n\u2208\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\left\\{a_{m}\\right\\}_{m\\in \\mathbb {N} }}\n\n the series\nis to be determined.

Both Aitken's method and Shanks transformation operate on a sequence, but the sequence the Shanks transformation operates on is usually thought of as being a sequence of partial sums, although any sequence may be viewed as a sequence of partial sums.\nAs an example, consider the slowly convergent series[3]\nwhich has the exact sum \u03c0\u00a0\u2248\u00a03.14159265. The partial sum \n\n\n\n\nA\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{6}}\n\n has only one digit accuracy, while six-figure accuracy requires summing about 400,000 terms.\nIn the table below, the partial sums \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{n}}\n\n, the Shanks transformation \n\n\n\nS\n(\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(A_{n})}\n\n on them, as well as the repeated Shanks transformations \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S^{2}(A_{n})}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n3\n\n\n(\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S^{3}(A_{n})}\n\n are given for \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n up to 12. The figure to the right shows the absolute error for the partial sums and Shanks transformation results, clearly showing the improved accuracy and convergence rate.\nThe Shanks transformation \n\n\n\nS\n(\n\nA\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(A_{1})}\n\n already has two-digit accuracy, while the original partial sums only establish the same accuracy at \n\n\n\n\nA\n\n24\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{24}.}\n\n Remarkably, \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n3\n\n\n(\n\nA\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S^{3}(A_{3})}\n\n has six digits accuracy, obtained from repeated Shank transformations applied to the first seven terms \n\n\n\n\nA\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nA\n\n6\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{0},\\ldots ,A_{6}.}\n\n As said before, \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{n}}\n\n only obtains 6-digit accuracy after about summing 400,000 terms.\nThe Shanks transformation is motivated by the observation that \u2014 for larger \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n \u2014 the partial sum \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{n}}\n\n quite often behaves approximately as[2]\nwith \n\n\n\n\n|\n\nq\n\n|\n\n<\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |q|<1}\n\n so that the sequence converges transiently to the series result \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n for \n\n\n\nn\n\u2192\n\u221e\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\to \\infty .}\n\n So for \n\n\n\nn\n\u2212\n1\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n-1,}\n\n \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n and \n\n\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n+1}\n\n the respective partial sums are:\nThese three equations contain three unknowns: \n\n\n\nA\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A,}\n\n \n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n\n and \n\n\n\nq\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q.}\n\n Solving for \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n gives[2]\nIn the (exceptional) case that the denominator is equal to zero: then \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n=\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{n}=A}\n\n for all \n\n\n\nn\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n.}\n\n\nThe generalized kth-order Shanks transformation is given as the ratio of the determinants:[4]\nwith \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\nA\n\np\n\n\n=\n\nA\n\np\n+\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n\nA\n\np\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta A_{p}=A_{p+1}-A_{p}.}\n\n It is the solution of a model for the convergence behaviour of the partial sums \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{n}}\n\n with \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n distinct transients:\nThis model for the convergence behaviour contains \n\n\n\n2\nk\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2k+1}\n\n unknowns.
