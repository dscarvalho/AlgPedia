It consists of much code from past GMP releases, and some original contributed code.[1]\nAccording to the MPIR developers, some of the main goals of the MPIR project are:\nMPIR is optimised for many processors (CPUs). Assembly language code exists for these as of 2012[update]: ARM, DEC Alpha 21064, 21164, and 21264, AMD K6, K6-2, Athlon, K8 and K10, Intel Pentium, Pentium Pro-II-III, Pentium 4, generic x86, Intel IA-64, Core 2, i7, Atom, Motorola-IBM PowerPC 32 and 64, MIPS R3000, R4000, SPARCv7, SuperSPARC, generic SPARCv8, UltraSPARC.\n\n",
