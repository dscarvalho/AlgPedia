Thus, signal-flow graph theory builds on that of directed graphs (also called digraphs), which includes as well that of oriented graphs. This mathematical theory of digraphs exists, of course, quite apart from its applications.[3][4]\nSFG's are most commonly used to represent signal flow in a physical system and its controller(s), forming a cyber-physical system. Among their other uses are the representation of signal flow in various electronic networks and amplifiers, digital filters, state variable filters and some other types of analog filters. In nearly all literature, a signal-flow graph is associated with a set of linear equations.\n\n\nWai-Kai Chen wrote: \"The concept of a signal-flow graph was originally worked out by Shannon [1942] [1] in dealing with analog computers. The greatest credit for the formulation of signal-flow graphs is normally extended to Mason [1953],[2] [1956].[5] He showed how to use the signal-flow graph technique to solve some difficult electronic problems in a relatively simple manner. The term signal flow graph was used because of its original application to electronic problems and the association with electronic signals and flowcharts of the systems under study.\"[6]\nLorens wrote: \"Previous to Mason's work, C. E. Shannon[1] worked out a number of the properties of what are now known as flow graphs. Unfortunately, the paper originally had a restricted classification and very few people had access to the material.\"[7]\n\"The rules for the evaluation of the graph determinant of a Mason Graph were first given and proven by Shannon [1942] using mathematical induction. His work remained essentially unknown even after Mason published his classical work in 1953. Three years later, Mason [1956] rediscovered the rules and proved them by considering the value of a determinant and how it changes as variables are added to the graph. [...]\"[8]\nRobichaud et al. identify the domain of application of SFGs as follows:[9]\nThe following illustration and its meaning were introduced by Mason to illustrate basic concepts:[2]\nIn the simple flow graphs of the figure, a functional dependence of a node is indicated by an incoming arrow, the node originating this influence is the beginning of this arrow, and in its most general form the signal flow graph indicates by incoming arrows only those nodes that influence the processing at the receiving node, and at each node, i, the incoming variables are processed according to a function associated with that node, say Fi. The flowgraph in (a) represents a set of explicit relationships:\nNode x1 is an isolated node because no arrow is incoming; the equations for x2 and x3 have the graphs shown in parts (b) and (c) of the figure.\nThese relationships define for every node a function that processes the input signals it receives. Each non-source node combines the input signals in some manner, and broadcasts a resulting signal along each outgoing branch. \"A flow graph, as defined originally by Mason, implies a set of functional relations, linear or not.\"[9]\nHowever, the commonly used Mason graph is more restricted, assuming that each node simply sums its incoming arrows, and that each branch involves only the initiating node involved. Thus, in this more restrictive approach, the node x1 is unaffected while:\nand now the functions fij can be associated with the signal-flow branches ij joining the pair of nodes xi, xj, rather than having general relationships associated with each node. A contribution by a node to itself like f33 for x3 is called a self-loop. Frequently these functions are simply multiplicative factors (often called transmittances or gains), for example, fij(xj)=cijxj, where c is a scalar, but possibly a function of some parameter like the Laplace transform variable s. Signal-flow graphs are very often used with Laplace-transformed signals, and in this case the transmittance, c(s), often is called a transfer function.\nIn general, there are several ways of choosing the variables in a complex system. Corresponding to each choice, a system of equations can be written and each system of equations can be represented in a graph. This formulation of the equations becomes direct and automatic if one has at his disposal techniques which permit the drawing of a graph directly from the schematic diagram of the system under study. The structure of the graphs thus obtained is related in a simple manner to the topology of the schematic diagram, and it becomes unnecessary to consider the equations, even implicitly, to obtain the graph. In some cases, one has simply to imagine the flow graph in the schematic diagram and the desired answers can be obtained without even drawing the flow graph.\nRobichaud et al. wrote: \"The signal flow graph contains the same information as the equations from which it is derived; but there does not exist a one-to-one correspondence between the graph and the system of equations. One system will give different graphs according to the order in which the equations are used to define the variable written on the left-hand side.\"[9] If all equations relate all dependent variables, then there are n! possible SFGs to choose from.[12]\nLinear signal-flow graph methods only apply to linear time-invariant systems, as studied by their associated theory. When modeling a system of interest, the first step is often to determine the equations representing the system's operation without assigning causes and effects (this is called acausal modeling). [13] A SFG is then derived from this system of equations.\nA linear SFG consists of nodes indicated by dots and weighted directional branches indicated by arrows. The nodes are the variables of the equations and the branch weights are the coefficients. Signals may only traverse a branch in the direction indicated by its arrow. The elements of a SFG can only represent the operations of multiplication by a coefficient and addition, which are sufficient to represent the constrained equations. When a signal traverses a branch in its indicated direction, the signal is multiplied the weight of the branch. When two or more branches direct into the same node, their outputs are added.\nFor systems described by linear algebraic or differential equations, the signal-flow graph is mathematically equivalent to the system of equations describing the system, and the equations governing the nodes are discovered for each node by summing incoming branches to that node. These incoming branches convey the contributions of the other nodes, expressed as the connected node value multiplied by the weight of the connecting branch, usually a real number or function of some parameter (for example a Laplace transform variable s).\nFor linear active networks, Choma writes:[14] \"By a \u2018signal flow representation\u2019 [or \u2018graph\u2019, as it is commonly referred to] we mean a diagram that, by displaying the algebraic relationships among relevant branch variables of network, paints an unambiguous picture of the way an applied input signal \u2018flows\u2019 from input-to-output [...] ports.\"\nA motivation for a SFG analysis is described by Chen:[15]\nA linear signal flow graph is related to a system of linear equations[16] of the following form:\nThe figure to the right depicts various elements and constructs of a signal flow graph (SFG).[17]\nTerms used in linear SFG theory also include:[17]\nA signal-flow graph may be simplified by graph transformation rules.[19][20][21] These simplification rules are also referred to as signal-flow graph algebra.[22] The purpose of this reduction is to relate the dependent variables of interest (residual nodes, sinks) to its independent variables (sources).\nThe systematic reduction of a linear signal-flow graph is a graphical method equivalent to the Gauss-Jordan elimination method for solving linear equations.[23]\nThe rules presented below may be applied over and over until the signal flow graph is reduced to its \"minimal residual form\". Further reduction can require loop elimination or the use of a \"reduction formula\" with the goal to directly connect sink nodes representing the dependent variables to the source nodes representing the independent variables. By these means, any signal-flow graph can be simplified by successively removing internal nodes until only the input and output and index nodes remain.[24][25] Robichaud described this process of systematic flow-graph reduction:\nThe reduction of a graph proceeds by the elimination of certain nodes to obtain a residual graph showing only the variables of interest. This elimination of nodes is called \"node absorption\". This method is close to the familiar process of successive eliminations of undesired variables in a system of equations. One can eliminate a variable by removing the corresponding node in the graph. If one reduces the graph sufficiently, it is possible to obtain the solution for any variable and this is the objective which will be kept in mind in this description of the different methods of reduction of the graph. In practice, however, the techniques of reduction will be used solely to transform the graph to a residual graph expressing some fundamental relationships. Complete solutions will be more easily obtained by application of Mason's rule.[26] The graph itself programs the reduction process. Indeed a simple inspection of the graph readily suggests the different steps of the reduction which are carried out by elementary transformations, by loop elimination, or by the use of a reduction formula.[26]\nFor digitally reducing a flow graph using an algorithm, Robichaud extends the notion of a simple flow graph to a generalized flow graph:\nBefore describing the process of reduction...the correspondence between the graph and a system of linear equations ... must be generalized...The generalized graphs will represent some operational relationships between groups of variables...To each branch of the generalized graph is associated a matrix giving the relationships between the variables represented by the nodes at the extremities of that branch...[27] The elementary transformations [defined by Robichaud in his Figure 7.2, p. 184] and the loop reduction permit the elimination of any node j of the graph by the reduction formula:[described in Robichaud's Equation 7-1]. With the reduction formula, it is always possible to reduce a graph of any order... [After reduction] the final graph will be a cascade graph in which the variables of the sink nodes are explicitly expressed as functions of the sources. This is the only method for reducing the generalized graph since Mason's rule is obviously inapplicable.[28]\nThe definition of an elementary transformation varies from author to author:\nParallel edges. Replace parallel edges with a single edge having a gain equal to the sum of original gains.\n\nThe graph on the left has parallel edges between nodes. On the right, these parallel edges have been replaced with a single edge having a gain equal to the sum of the gains on each original edge.\nThe equations corresponding to the reduction between N and node I1 are:\nOutflowing edges. Replace outflowing edges with edges directly flowing from the node's sources.\n\nThe graph on the left has an intermediate node N between nodes from which it has inflows, and nodes to which it flows out. The graph on the right shows direct flows between these node sets, without transiting via N.\nFor the sake of simplicity, N and its inflows are not represented. The outflows from N are eliminated.\nThe equations corresponding to the reduction directly relating N's input signals to its output signals are:\nZero-signal nodes.\nEliminate outflowing edges from a node determined to have a value of zero.\n\nIf the value of a node is zero, its outflowing edges can be eliminated.\nNodes without outflows.\nEliminate a node without outflows.\n\nIn this case, N is not a variable of interest, and it has no outgoing edges; therefore, N, and its inflowing edges, can be eliminated.\nSelf-looping edge. Replace looping edges by adjusting the gains on the incoming edges.\n\nThe graph on the left has a looping edge at node N, with a gain of g. On the right, the looping edge has been eliminated, and all inflowing edges have their gain divided by (1-g).\nThe equations corresponding to the reduction between N and all its input signals are:\nThe above procedure for building the SFG from an acausal system of equations and for solving the SFG's gains have been implemented[31] as an add-on to MATHLAB 68,[32] an on-line system providing machine aid for the mechanical symbolic processes encountered in analysis.\nSignal flow graphs can be used to solve sets of simultaneous linear equations.[33] The set of equations must be consistent and all equations must be linearly independent.\nFor M equations with N unknowns where each yj is a known value and each xj is an unknown value, there is equation for each known of the following form.\nAlthough it is feasible, particularly for simple cases, to establish a signal flow graph using the equations in this form, some rearrangement allows a general procedure that works easily for any set of equations, as now is presented. To proceed, first the equations are rewritten as\nand further rewritten as\nand finally rewritten as\nThe signal-flow graph is now arranged by selecting one of these equations and addressing the node on the right-hand side. This is the node for which the node connects to itself with the branch of weight including a '+1', making a self-loop in the flow graph. The other terms in that equation connect this node first to the source in this equation and then to all the other branches incident on this node. Every equation is treated this way, and then each incident branch is joined to its respective emanating node. For example, the case of three variables is shown in the figure, and the first equation is:\nwhere the right side of this equation is the sum of the weighted arrows incident on node x1.\nAs there is a basic symmetry in the treatment of every node, a simple starting point is an arrangement of nodes with each node at one vertex of a regular polygon. When expressed using the general coefficients {cin}, the environment of each node is then just like all the rest apart from a permutation of indices. Such an implementation for a set of three simultaneous equations is seen in the figure.[34]\nOften the known values, yj are taken as the primary causes and the unknowns values, xj to be effects, but regardless of this interpretation, the last form for the set of equations can be represented as a signal-flow graph. This point is discussed further in the subsection Interpreting 'causality'.\nIn the most general case, the values for all the xk variables can be calculated by computing Mason's gain formula for the path from each yj to each xk and using superposition.\nIn general, there are N-1 paths from yj to variable xk so the computational effort to calculated Gkj is proportional to N-1. Since there are M values of yj, Gkj must be computed M times for a single value of xk. The computational effort to calculate a single xk variable is proportional to (N-1)(M). The effort to compute all the xk variables is proportional to (N)(N-1)(M). If there are N equations and N unknowns, then the computation effort is on the order of N3.\nFor some authors, a linear signal-flow graph is more constrained than a block diagram,[35] in that the SFG rigorously describes linear algebraic equations represented by a directed graph.\nFor other authors, linear block diagrams and linear signal-flow graphs are equivalent ways of depicting a system, and either can be used to solve the gain. [36]\nA tabulation of the comparison between block diagrams and signal-flow graphs is provided by Bakshi & Bakshi,[37] and another tabulation by Kumar.[38] According to Barker et al.:[39]\nIn the figure, a simple block diagram for a feedback system is shown with two possible interpretations as a signal-flow graph. The input R(s) is the Laplace-transformed input signal; it is shown as a source node in the signal-flow graph (a source node has no input edges). The output signal C(s) is the Laplace-transformed output variable. It is represented as a sink node in the flow diagram (a sink has no output edges). G(s) and H(s) are transfer functions, with H(s) serving to feed back a modified version of the output to the input, B(s). The two flow graph representations are equivalent.\nThe term \"cause and effect\" was applied by Mason to SFGs:[2]\nand has been repeated by many later authors:[40]\nHowever, Mason's paper is concerned to show in great detail how a set of equations is connected to an SFG, an emphasis unrelated to intuitive notions of \"cause and effect\". Intuitions can be helpful for arriving at an SFG or for gaining insight from an SFG, but are inessential to the SFG. The essential connection of the SFG is to its own set of equations, as described, for example, by Ogata:[41]\nThere is no reference to \"cause and effect\" here, and as said by Barutsky:[42]\nThe term \"cause and effect\" may be misinterpreted as it applies to the SFG, and taken incorrectly to suggest a system view of causality,[43] rather than a computationally based meaning. To keep discussion clear, it may be advisable to use the term \"computational causality\", as is suggested for bond graphs:[44]\nThe term \"computational causality\" is explained using the example of current and voltage in a resistor:[45]\nA computer program or algorithm can be arranged to solve a set of equations using various strategies. They differ in how they prioritize finding some of the variables in terms of the others, and these algorithmic decisions, which are simply about solution strategy, then set up the variables expressed as dependent variables earlier in the solution to be \"effects\", determined by the remaining variables that now are \"causes\", in the sense of \"computational causality\".\nUsing this terminology, it is computational causality, not system causality, that is relevant to the SFG. There exists a wide-ranging philosophical debate, not concerned specifically with the SFG, over connections between computational causality and system causality.[46]\nSignal-flow graphs can be used for analysis, that is for understanding a model of an existing system, or for synthesis, that is for determining the properties of a design alternative.\nWhen building a model of a dynamic system, a list of steps is provided by Dorf & Bishop:[47]\nIn this workflow, equations of the physical system's mathematical model are used to derive the signal-flow graph equations.\nSignal-flow graphs have been used in Design Space Exploration (DSE), as an intermediate representation towards a physical implementation. The DSE process seeks a suitable solution among different alternatives. In contrast with the typical analysis workflow, where a system of interest is first modeled with the physical equations of its components, the specification for synthesizing a design could be a desired transfer function. For example, different strategies would create different signal-flow graphs, from which implementations are derived.[48] Another example uses an annotated SFG as an expression of the continuous-time behavior, as input to an architecture generator[49]\nShannon's formula is an analytic expression for calculating the gain of an interconnected set of amplifiers in an analog computer. During World War II, while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer, Claude Shannon developed his formula. Because of wartime restrictions, Shannon's work was not published at that time, and, in 1952, Mason rediscovered the same formula.\nHapp generalized the Shannon formula for topologically closed systems.[50] The Shannon-Happ formula can be used for deriving transfer functions, sensitivities, and error functions.[51]\nFor a consistent set of linear unilateral relations, the Shannon-Happ formula expresses the solution using direct substitution (non-iterative).[51][52]\nNASA's electrical circuit software NASAP is based on the Shannon-Happ formula.[51][52]\nThe amplification of a signal V1 by an amplifier with gain a12 is described mathematically by\nThis relationship represented by the signal-flow graph of Figure 1. is that V2 is dependent on V1 but it implies no dependency of V1 on V2. See Kou page 57.[53]\nA possible SFG for the asymptotic gain model for a negative feedback amplifier is shown in Figure 3, and leads to the equation for the gain of this amplifier as\nThe interpretation of the parameters is as follows: T = return ratio, G\u221e = direct amplifier gain, G0 = feedforward (indicating the possible bilateral nature of the feedback, possibly deliberate as in the case of feedforward compensation). Figure 3 has the interesting aspect that it resembles Figure 2 for the two-port network with the addition of the extra feedback relation x2 = T y1.\nFrom this gain expression an interpretation of the parameters G0 and G\u221e is evident, namely:\nThere are many possible SFG's associated with any particular gain relation. Figure 4 shows another SFG for the asymptotic gain model that can be easier to interpret in terms of a circuit. In this graph, parameter \u03b2 is interpreted as a feedback factor and A as a \"control parameter\", possibly related to a dependent source in the circuit. Using this graph, the gain is\nTo connect to the asymptotic gain model, parameters A and \u03b2 cannot be arbitrary circuit parameters, but must relate to the return ratio T by:\nand to the asymptotic gain as:\nSubstituting these results into the gain expression,\nwhich is the formula of the asymptotic gain model.\nThe figure to the right depicts a circuit that contains a y-parameter two-port network. Vin is the input of the circuit and V2 is the output. The two-port equations impose a set of linear constraints between its port voltages and currents. The terminal equations impose other constraints. All these constraints are represented in the SFG (Signal Flow Graph) below the circuit. There is only one path from input to output which is shown in a different color and has a (voltage) gain of -RLy21. There are also three loops: -Riny11, -RLy22, Riny21RLy12. Sometimes a loop indicates intentional feedback but it can also indicate a constraint on the relationship of two variables. For example, the equation that describes a resistor says that the ratio of the voltage across the resistor to the current through the resistor is a constant which is called the resistance. This can be interpreted as the voltage is the input and the current is the output, or the current is the input and the voltage is the output, or merely that the voltage and current have a linear relationship. Virtually all passive two terminal devices in a circuit will show up in the SFG as a loop.\nThe SFG and the schematic depict the same circuit, but the schematic also suggests the circuit's purpose. Compared to the schematic, the SFG is awkward but it does have the advantage that the input to output gain can be written down by inspection using Mason's rule.\nThis example is representative of a SFG (signal-flow graph) used to represent a servo control system and illustrates several features of SFGs. Some of the loops (loop 3, loop 4 and loop 5) are extrinsic intentionally designed feedback loops. These are shown with dotted lines. There are also intrinsic loops (loop 0, loop1, loop2) that are not intentional feedback loops, although they can be analyzed as though they were. These loops are shown with solid lines. Loop 3 and loop 4 are also known as minor loops because they are inside a larger loop.\nSee Mason's rule for development of Mason's Gain Formula for this example.\nThere is some confusion in literature about what a signal-flow graph is; Henry Paynter, inventor of bond graphs, writes: \"But much of the decline of signal-flow graphs [...] is due in part to the mistaken notion that the branches must be linear and the nodes must be summative. Neither assumption was embraced by Mason, himself\u00a0!\"[55]\nA state transition SFG or state diagram is a simulation diagram for a system of equations, including the initial conditions of the states.[56]\nClosed flowgraphs describe closed systems and have been utilized to provide a rigorous theoretical basis for topological techniques of circuit analysis.[50]\nMason introduced both nonlinear and linear flow graphs. To clarify this point, Mason wrote\u00a0: \"A linear flow graph is one whose associated equations are linear.\"[2]\nIt we denote by xj the signal at node j, the following are examples of node functions that do not pertain to a linear time-invariant system:",
