    "about": "The GAPP (Geometric Arithmetic Parallel Processor), invented by Polish mathematician W\u0142odzimierz Holszty\u0144ski in 1981, was patented by Martin Marietta[1] and is now owned by Silicon Optix, Inc. The GAPP's network topology is a mesh-connected array of single-bit SIMD processing elements (PEs), where each PE can communicate with its neighbor to the north, east, south, and west. Each cell has its own memory. The space of addresses is the same for all cells. The data travels from the cell memories to the cell registers, and in the opposite direction, in parallel. Characteristically, the cell's ALU (that is, its PE) in the early versions of GAPP was nothing but a 1-bit full-adder/subtractor, which efficiently served both the complex arithmetic as well as logical functions, and with the help of shifts it served also the geometric transformations\u2014in short, it was doing all three types of the tasks (while other designs used three separate hardware special-purpose units instead).",
