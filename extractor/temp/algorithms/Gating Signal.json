If Wiktionary does not have the definition yet, consider moving the whole article to Wiktionary by replacing this tag with the template {{Copy to Wiktionary}}.\nThis template will no longer automatically categorize articles as candidates to move to Wiktionary.\nA gating signal is a digital signal or pulse (sometimes called a \"trigger\") that provides a time window so that a particular event or signal from among many will be selected and others will be eliminated or discarded.\nIn a multiple input AND/OR gate, a signal at one of the inputs triggers the passage of a signal at other inputs; i.e., it passes through or blocks the signal at other inputs. Such a signal is called a gating signal.\nSignal gating means to mask unwanted signal transitions from propagating forward.",
