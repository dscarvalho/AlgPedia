Its effectiveness comes from the fact that an arbitrary position in an array can be examined in constant time.",

Its effectiveness comes from the fact that an arbitrary position in an array can be examined in constant time.\n\n\nThere are many practical examples of data whose valid values are restricted within a small range. A trivial hash function is a suitable choice when such data needs to act as a lookup key. Some examples include:\nUsing a trivial hash function, in a non-iterative table lookup, can eliminate conditional testing and branching completely, reducing the instruction path length of a computer program.\nRoger Sayle gives an example[2] of eliminating a multiway branch caused by a switch statement:\nWhich can be replaced with a table lookup:",
