    "full_text": "Featherstone's algorithm is a technique used for computing the effects of forces applied to a structure of joints and links (an \"open kinematic chain\") such as a skeleton used in ragdoll physics.\nThe Featherstone's algorithm uses a reduced coordinate representation. This is in contrast to the more popular Lagrange multiplier method, which uses maximal coordinates. Brian Mirtich's PhD Thesis has a very clear and detailed description of the algorithm. Baraff's paper \"Linear-time dynamics using Lagrange multipliers\" has a discussion and comparison of both algorithms.\n",
