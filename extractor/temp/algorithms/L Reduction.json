L-reductions in studies of approximability of optimization problems play a similar role to that of polynomial reductions in the studies of computational complexity of decision problems.\nThe term L reduction is sometimes used to refer to log-space reductions, by analogy with the complexity class L, but this is a different concept.\n\n\nLet A and B be optimization problems and cA and cB their respective cost functions. A pair of functions f and g is an L-reduction if all of the following conditions are met:\nAn L-reduction from problem A to problem B implies an AP-reduction when A and B are minimization problems and a PTAS reduction when A and B are maximization problems. In both cases, when B has a PTAS and there is a L-reduction from A to B, then A also has a PTAS.[1][2] This enables the use of L-reduction as a replacement for showing the existence of a PTAS-reduction; Crescenzi has suggested that the more natural formulation of L-reduction is actually more useful in many cases due to ease of usage.[3]\nLet the approximation ratio of B be \n\n\n\n1\n+\n\u03b4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1+\\delta }\n\n.

We can remove absolute values around the third condition of the L-reduction definition since we know A and B are minimization problems. Substitute that condition to obtain\nSimplifying, and substituting the first condition, we have\nBut the term in parentheses on the right-hand side actually equals \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\delta }\n\n.
