The concept was first introduced as such by Ham, Lee, and Saul in 2003,[1] adding a manifold constraint to the general problem of correlating sets of high-dimensional vectors.[2]\n\n\nManifold alignment assumes that disparate data sets produced by similar generating processes will share a similar underlying manifold representation. By learning projections from each original space to the shared manifold, correspondences are recovered and knowledge from one domain can be transferred to another. Most manifold alignment techniques consider only two data sets, but the concept extends to arbitrarily many initial data sets.\nConsider the case of aligning two data sets, \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n and \n\n\n\nY\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Y}\n\n, with \n\n\n\n\nX\n\ni\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{i}\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{m}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nY\n\ni\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Y_{i}\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n\n.\nManifold alignment algorithms attempt to project both \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n and \n\n\n\nY\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Y}\n\n into a new d-dimensional space such that the projections both minimize distance between corresponding points and preserve the local manifold structure of the original data.

However, this information is usually difficult or impossible to obtain in real world applications. Recent work has extended the core manifold alignment algorithm to semi-supervised [4] , unsupervised [5] , and multiple-instance [6] settings.\nThe algorithm described above performs a \"one-step\" alignment, finding embeddings for both data sets at the same time. A similar effect can also be achieved with \"two-step\" alignments [7] [8] , following a slightly modified procedure:\nManifold alignment can be used to find linear (feature-level) projections, or nonlinear (instance-level) embeddings. While the instance-level version generally produces more accurate alignments, it sacrifices a great degree of flexibility as the learned embedding is often difficult to parameterize. Feature-level projections allow any new instances to be easily embedded in the manifold space, and projections may be combined to form direct mappings between the original data representations. These properties are especially important for knowledge-transfer applications.\nManifold alignment is suited to problems with several corpora that lie on a shared manifold, even when each corpus is of a different dimensionality. Many real-world problems fit this description, but traditional techniques are not able to take advantage of all corpora at the same time. Manifold alignment also facilitates transfer learning, in which knowledge of one domain is used to jump-start learning in correlated domains.\nApplications of manifold alignment include:",
