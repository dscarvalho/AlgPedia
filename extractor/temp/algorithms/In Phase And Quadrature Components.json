All three functions have the same frequency. The amplitude modulated sinusoids are known as in-phase and quadrature components.[1]\u00a0 Some authors find it more convenient to refer to only the amplitude modulation (baseband) itself by those terms.[2]\n\n\nIn vector analysis, a vector with polar coordinates A,\u03c6 and Cartesian coordinates x=A\u2022cos(\u03c6), y=A\u2022sin(\u03c6), can be represented as the sum of orthogonal \"components\":\u00a0 [x,0]\u00a0+\u00a0[0,y].\u00a0 Similarly in trigonometry, the expression sin(x+\u03c6) can be represented by sin(x)cos(\u03c6)\u00a0+\u00a0sin(x+\u03c0/2)sin(\u03c6).\u00a0 And in functional analysis, when x is a linear function of some variable, such as time, these components are sinusoids, and they are orthogonal functions. When \u03c6=0,\u00a0 sin(x+\u03c6) reduces to just the in-phase component sin(x)cos(\u03c6),\u00a0 and the quadrature component sin(x+\u03c0/2)sin(\u03c6) is zero.\nWe now note that many authors prefer the identity cos(x+\u03c6)\u00a0=\u00a0cos(x)cos(\u03c6)\u00a0+\u00a0cos(x+\u03c0/2)sin(\u03c6),\u00a0 in which case cos(x)cos(\u03c6) is the in-phase component.\u00a0 In both conventions cos(\u03c6) is the in-phase amplitude modulation, which explains why some authors refer to it as the actual in-phase component. We can also observe that in both conventions the quadrature component leads the in-phase component by one-quarter cycle.\nThe term alternating current applies to a voltage vs time function that is sinusoidal with a frequency, \n\n\n\n\nf\n,\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle f,}\n\n\u00a0 of 50 or 60 Hz. When it is applied to a typical circuit or device, it causes a current that is also sinusoidal. And in general there is a constant phase difference, \u03c6, between the two sinusoids. The sinusoidal voltage stimulus is usually defined to have zero phase, meaning that it is arbitrarily chosen as a convenient time reference. So the phase difference is attributed to the current function, e.g. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n(\n2\n\u03c0\nf\nt\n+\n\u03d5\n)\n,\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\sin(2\\pi ft+\\phi ),}\n\n\u00a0 whose orthogonal components are \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n(\n2\n\u03c0\nf\nt\n)\ncos\n\u2061\n(\n\u03d5\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\sin(2\\pi ft)\\cos(\\phi )}\n\n\u00a0 and \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n(\n2\n\u03c0\nf\nt\n+\n\u03c0\n\n/\n\n2\n)\nsin\n\u2061\n(\n\u03d5\n)\n,\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\sin(2\\pi ft+\\pi /2)\\sin(\\phi ),}\n\n\u00a0 as we have seen.\u00a0 When \u03c6 happens to be such that the in-phase component is zero, the current and voltage sinusoids are said to be in quadrature, which means they are orthogonal to each other. In that case, no electrical power is consumed. Rather it is temporarily stored by the device and given back, once every \n\n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\nf\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle 1/f}\n\n\u00a0 seconds.\u00a0 Note that the term in quadrature only implies that two sinusoids are orthogonal, not that they are components of another sinusoid.\nIn an angle modulation application, with carrier frequency \n\n\n\n\nf\n,\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle f,}\n\n\u00a0 \u03c6 is also a time-variant function, giving:\nWhen all three terms above are multiplied by an optional amplitude function, A(t)>0,\u00a0 the left-hand side of the equality is known as the amplitude/phase form, and the right-hand side is the quadrature-carrier or IQ form. Because of the modulation, the components are no longer completely orthogonal functions. But when A(t) and \u03c6(t) are slowly varying functions compared to \n\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\nf\nt\n,\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle 2\\pi ft,}\n\n\u00a0 the assumption of orthogonality is a common one. Authors often call it a narrowband assumption, or a narrowband signal model.[3][4]\u00a0 Orthogonality is important in many applications, including demodulation, direction-finding, and bandpass sampling.",
