Instead of maintaining a tableau which explicitly represents the constraints adjusted to a set of basic variables, it maintains a representation of a basis of the matrix representing the constraints. The matrix-oriented approach allows for greater computational efficiency by enabling sparse matrix operations.[1]\n\n\nFor the rest of the discussion, it is assumed that a linear programming problem has been converted into the following standard form:\nwhere A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the constraint matrix A has full row rank and that the problem is feasible, i.e., there is at least one x \u2265 0 such that Ax = b. If A is rank-deficient, either there are redundant constraints, or the problem is infeasible. Both situations can be handled by a presolve step.\nFor linear programming, the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions are both necessary and sufficient for optimality. The KKT conditions of a linear programming problem in the standard form is\nwhere \u03bb and s are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints Ax = b and x \u2265 0, respectively.[2] The last condition, which is equivalent to sixi = 0 for all 1 < i < n, is called the complementary slackness condition.\nBy what is sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of linear programming, a vertex x of the feasible polytope can be identified by being a basis B of A chosen from the latter's columns.[a] Since A has full rank, B is nonsingular. Without loss of generality, assume that A = [B\u2002N]. Then x is given by\nwhere xB \u2265 0. Partition c and s accordingly into\nTo satisfy the complementary slackness condition, let sB = 0. It follows that\nwhich implies that\nIf sN \u2265 0 at this point, the KKT conditions are satisfied, and thus x is optimal.\nIf the KKT conditions are violated, a pivot operation consisting of introducing a column of N into the basis at the expense of an existing column in B is performed. In the absence of degeneracy, a pivot operation always results in a strict decrease in cTx. Therefore, if the problem is bounded, the revised simplex method must terminate at an optimal vertex after repeated pivot operations because there are only a finite number of vertices.[4]\nSelect an index m < q \u2264 n such that sq < 0 as the entering index. The corresponding column of A, Aq, will be moved into the basis, and xq will be allowed to increase from zero. It can be shown that\ni.e., every unit increase in xq will results in a decrease by \u2212sq in cTx.[5] Since\nxB must be correspondingly decreased by \u0394xB = B\u22121Aqxq subject to xB \u2212 \u0394xB \u2265 0. Let d = B\u22121Aq. If d \u2264 0, no matter how much xq is increased, xB \u2212 \u0394xB will stay nonnegative. Hence, cTx can be arbitrarily decreased, and thus the problem is unbounded. Otherwise, select an index p = argmin1\u2264i\u2264m {xi/di | di > 0} as the leaving index. This choice effectively increases xq from zero until xp is reduced to zero while maintaining feasibility. The pivot operation concludes with replacing Ap with Aq in the basis.\nConsider a linear program where\nLet\ninitially, which corresponds to a feasible vertex x = [0\u20020\u20020\u200210\u200215]T. At this moment,\nChoose q = 3 as the entering index. Then d = [1\u20023]T, which means a unit increase in x3 will results in x4 and x5 being decreased by 1 and 3, respectively. Therefore, x3 is increased to 5, at which point x5 is reduced to zero, and p = 5 becomes the leaving index.\nAfter the pivot operation,\nCorrespondingly,\nA positive sN indicates that x is now optimal.\nBecause the revised simplex method is mathematically equivalent to the simplex method, it also suffers from degeneracy, where a pivot operation does not result in a decrease in cTx, and a chain of pivot operations causes the basis to cycle. A perturbation or lexicographic strategy can be used to prevent cycling and guarantee termination.[6]\nTwo types of linear systems involving B are present in the revised simplex method:\nInstead of refactorizing B, usually an LU factorization is directly updated after each pivot operation, for which purpose there exist several strategies such as the Forrest\u2212Tomlin and Bartels\u2212Golub methods. However, the amount of data representing the updates as well as numerical errors builds up over time and makes periodic refactorization necessary.[1][7]",
