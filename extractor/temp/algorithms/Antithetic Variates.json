Considering that the error reduction in the simulated signal (using Monte Carlo methods) has a square root convergence, a very large number of sample paths is required to obtain an accurate result. The antithetic variates method reduces the variance of the simulation results.\nThe antithetic variates technique consists, for every sample path obtained, in taking its antithetic path \u2014 that is given a path \n\n\n\n{\n\n\u03b5\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\n\u03b5\n\nM\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\varepsilon _{1},\\dots ,\\varepsilon _{M}\\}}\n\n to also take \n\n\n\n{\n\u2212\n\n\u03b5\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\u2212\n\n\u03b5\n\nM\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{-\\varepsilon _{1},\\dots ,-\\varepsilon _{M}\\}}\n\n. The advantage of this technique is twofold: it reduces the number of normal samples to be taken to generate N paths, and it reduces the variance of the sample paths, improving the accuracy.\nSuppose that we would like to estimate\nFor that we have generated two samples\nAn unbiased estimate of \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\theta }}\n\n is given by\nAnd\nso variance is reduced if \n\n\n\nC\no\nv\n(\n\nY\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nY\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Cov(Y_{1},Y_{2})}\n\n is negative.\nIf the law of the variable X follows a uniform distribution along [0,\u00a01], the first sample will be \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nu\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u_{1},\\ldots ,u_{n}}\n\n, where, for any given i, \n\n\n\n\nu\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u_{i}}\n\n is obtained from U(0,\u00a01). The second sample is built from \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n1\n\n\u2032\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nu\n\nn\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u'_{1},\\ldots ,u'_{n}}\n\n, where, for any given i: \n\n\n\n\nu\n\ni\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\nu\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u'_{i}=1-u_{i}}\n\n. If the set \n\n\n\n\nu\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u_{1}}\n\n is uniform along [0,\u00a01], so are \n\n\n\n\nu\n\ni\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u'_{i}}\n\n. Furthermore, covariance is negative, allowing for initial variance reduction.\nWe would like to estimate\nThe exact result is \n\n\n\nI\n=\nln\n\u2061\n2\n\u2248\n0.69314718\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I=\\ln 2\\approx 0.69314718}\n\n.
