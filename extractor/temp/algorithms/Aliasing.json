It also refers to the distortion or artifact that results when the signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.\nAliasing can occur in signals sampled in time, for instance digital audio, and is referred to as temporal aliasing. Aliasing can also occur in spatially sampled signals, for instance moir\u00e9 patterns in digital images. Aliasing in spatially sampled signals is called spatial aliasing.\nAliasing is generally avoided by applying low pass filters- anti-aliasing filters to the analog signal before sampling.\n\n\nWhen a digital image is viewed, a reconstruction is performed by a display or printer device, and by the eyes and the brain. If the image data is processed in some ways during sampling or reconstruction, the reconstructed image will differ from the original image, and an alias is seen.\nAn example of spatial aliasing is the moir\u00e9 pattern observed in a poorly pixelized image of a brick wall. Spatial anti-aliasing techniques avoid such poor pixelizations. Aliasing can be caused either by the sampling stage or the reconstruction stage; these may be distinguished by calling sampling aliasing  prealiasing and reconstruction aliasing  postaliasing.[1]\nTemporal aliasing is a major concern in the sampling of video and audio signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If a piece of music is sampled at 32000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components above 16000 Hz (the Nyquist frequency for this sampling rate) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital to analog converter (DAC). To prevent this an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the Nyquist frequency prior to sampling.\nIn video or cinematography, temporal aliasing results from the limited frame rate, and causes the wagon-wheel effect, whereby a spoked wheel appears to rotate too slowly or even backwards. Aliasing has changed its apparent frequency of rotation. A reversal of direction can be described as a negative frequency. Temporal aliasing frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the camera, but the relative intensity of the aliased frequencies is determined by the shutter timing (exposure time) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction filter during filming.[2]\nLike the video camera, most sampling schemes are periodic; that is, they have a characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space. Digital cameras provide a certain number of samples (pixels) per degree or per radian, or samples per mm in the focal plane of the camera. Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an analog-to-digital converter, which produces a constant number of samples per second. Some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content.\nActual signals have finite duration and their frequency content, as defined by the Fourier transform, has no upper bound. Some amount of aliasing always occurs when such functions are sampled. Functions whose frequency content is bounded (bandlimited) have infinite duration. If sampled at a high enough rate, determined by the bandwidth, the original function can in theory be perfectly reconstructed from the infinite set of samples.\nSometimes aliasing is used intentionally on signals with no low-frequency content, called bandpass signals. Undersampling, which creates low-frequency aliases, can produce the same result, with less effort, as frequency-shifting the signal to lower frequencies before sampling at the lower rate. Some digital channelizers[3] exploit aliasing in this way for computational efficiency. See Sampling (signal processing), Nyquist rate (relative to sampling), and Filter bank.\nSinusoids are an important type of periodic function, because realistic signals are often modeled as the summation of many sinusoids of different frequencies and different amplitudes (for example, with a Fourier series or transform). Understanding what aliasing does to the individual sinusoids is useful in understanding what happens to their sum.\nHere, a plot depicts a set of samples whose sample-interval is 1, and two (of many) different sinusoids that could have produced the samples. The sample-rate in this case is \n\n\n\n\nf\n\ns\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{s}=1\\,}\n\n. For instance, if the interval is 1 second, the rate is 1 sample per second. Nine cycles of the red sinusoid and 1 cycle of the blue sinusoid span an interval of 10 samples.

Folding is often observed in practice when viewing the frequency spectrum of real-valued samples, such as the second figure below.\nComplex sinusoids are waveforms whose samples are complex numbers, and the concept of negative frequency is necessary to distinguish them. In that case, the frequencies of the aliases are given by just: \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\na\nl\ni\na\ns\n\n\n\n(\nN\n)\n=\nf\n\u2212\nN\n\nf\n\ns\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{\\mathrm {alias} }(N)=f-Nf_{s}.\\,}\n\n\u00a0 Therefore, as \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle f\\,}\n\n increases from \n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\ns\n\n\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle f_{s}/2\\,}\n\n\u00a0 to \n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\ns\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle f_{s},\\,}\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\na\nl\ni\na\ns\n\n\n\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle f_{\\mathrm {alias} }(1)}\n\n goes from \n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\nf\n\ns\n\n\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle -f_{s}/2\\,}\n\n\u00a0 up to 0.\u00a0 Consequently, complex sinusoids do not exhibit folding. Complex samples of real-valued sinusoids have zero-valued imaginary parts and do exhibit folding.\nWhen the condition \n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\ns\n\n\n\n/\n\n2\n\u00a0\n>\n\u00a0\nf\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle f_{s}/2\\ >\\ f}\n\n is met for the highest frequency component of the original signal, then it is met for all the frequency components, a condition called the Nyquist criterion. That is typically approximated by filtering the original signal to attenuate high frequency components before it is sampled. These attenuated high frequency components still generate low-frequency aliases, but typically at low enough amplitudes that they do not cause problems. A filter chosen in anticipation of a certain sample frequency is called an anti-aliasing filter.\nThe filtered signal can subsequently be reconstructed, by interpolation algorithms, without significant additional distortion. Most sampled signals are not simply stored and reconstructed. But the fidelity of a theoretical reconstruction (via the Whittaker\u2013Shannon interpolation formula) is a customary measure of the effectiveness of sampling.\nHistorically the term aliasing evolved from radio engineering because of the action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but on the wrong side of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal.\nAliasing occurs whenever the use of discrete elements to capture or produce a continuous signal causes frequency ambiguity.\nSpatial aliasing, particular of angular frequency, can occur when reproducing a light field[4] or sound field with discrete elements, as in 3D displays or wave field synthesis of sound.\nThis aliasing is visible in images such as posters with lenticular printing: if they have low angular resolution, then as one moves past them, say from left-to-right, the 2D image does not initially change (so it appears to move left), then as one moves to the next angular image, the image suddenly changes (so it jumps right) \u2013 and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image (and, for frequency, the speed of the viewer's lateral movement), which is the angular aliasing of the 4D light field.\nThe lack of parallax on viewer movement in 2D images and in 3-D film produced by stereoscopic glasses (in 3D films the effect is called \"yawing\", as the image appears to rotate on its axis) can similarly be seen as loss of angular resolution, all angular frequencies being aliased to 0 (constant).\nThe qualitative effects of aliasing can be heard in the following audio demonstration. Six sawtooth waves are played in succession, with the first two sawtooths having a fundamental frequency of 440\u00a0Hz (A4), the second two having fundamental frequency of 880\u00a0Hz (A5), and the final two at 1760\u00a0Hz (A6). The sawtooths alternate between bandlimited (non-aliased) sawtooths and aliased sawtooths and the sampling rate is 22.05\u00a0kHz. The bandlimited sawtooths are synthesized from the sawtooth waveform's Fourier series such that no harmonics above the Nyquist frequency are present.\nThe aliasing distortion in the lower frequencies is increasingly obvious with higher fundamental frequencies, and while the bandlimited sawtooth is still clear at 1760\u00a0Hz, the aliased sawtooth is degraded and harsh with a buzzing audible at frequencies lower than the fundamental.\nA form of spatial aliasing can also occur in antenna arrays or microphone arrays used to estimate the direction of arrival of a wave signal, as in geophysical exploration by seismic waves. Waves must be sampled at more than two points per wavelength, or the wave arrival direction becomes ambiguous.[5]",
