    "about": "Cristian's algorithm (introduced by Flaviu Cristian in 1989)[1] is a method for clock synchronization which can be used in many fields of distributive computer science but is primarily used in low-latency intranets. Cristian observed that this simple algorithm is probabilistic, in that it only achieves synchronization if the round-trip time (RTT) of the request is short compared to required accuracy. It also suffers in implementations using a single server, making it unsuitable for many distributive applications where redundancy may be crucial.",

Cristian observed that this simple algorithm is probabilistic, in that it only achieves synchronization if the round-trip time (RTT) of the request is short compared to required accuracy. It also suffers in implementations using a single server, making it unsuitable for many distributive applications where redundancy may be crucial.\nCristian algorithm works between a process P, and a time server S \u2014 connected to a source of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Put simply:\nThis method assumes that the RTT is split equally between request and response, which may not always be the case but is a reasonable assumption on a LAN connection.\nFurther accuracy can be gained by making multiple requests to S and using the response with the shortest RTT.\nWe can estimate the accuracy of the system as follows. Let min be the minimum time to transmit a message one-way. The earliest point at which S could have placed the time T, was min after P sent its request. Therefore, the time at S, when the message by P is received, is in the range (T + min) to (T + RTT - min). The width of this range is (RTT - 2*min). This gives an accuracy of (RTT/2 - min).\nOther time synchronization protocols:",
