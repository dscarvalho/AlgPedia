They are a natural extension of wavelets to accommodate the fact that multivariate functions are typically governed by anisotropic features such as edges in images, however, wavelets as isotropic objects are not capable of capturing such phenomena.\nShearlets are constructed by parabolic scaling, shearing and translation applied to a few generating functions. At fine scales, they are essentially supported within skinny and directional ridges following the parabolic scaling law, which reads length\u00b2 \u2248 width. Similar to wavelets, shearlets arise from the affine group and allow a unified treatment of the continuum and digital situation leading to faithful implementations. Although they do not constitute an orthonormal basis for \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L^{2}(\\mathbb {R} ^{2})}\n\n, they still form a frame allowing stable expansions of arbitrary functions \n\n\n\nf\n\u2208\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f\\in L^{2}(\\mathbb {R} ^{2})}\n\n.\nOne of the most important properties of shearlets is the fact that they provide optimally sparse approximations (in the sense of optimality in [2]) for cartoon-like functions \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n. In imaging sciences, cartoon-like functions serve as a model for anisotropic features and are compactly supported in \n\n\n\n[\n0\n,\n1\n\n]\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [0,1]^{2}}\n\n while being \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C^{2}}\n\n apart from a closed piecewise \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C^{2}}\n\n singularity curve with bounded curvature.

A comprehensive presentation of the theory and applications of shearlets can be found in: [5]\n\n\nThe construction of continuous shearlet systems is based on parabolic scaling matrices\nas a mean to change the resolution, on shear matrices\nas a means to change the orientation, and finally on translations to change the positioning.

It can be shown that the corresponding discrete shearlet system \n\n\n\nSH\n\u2061\n(\n\u03c8\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\operatorname {SH} (\\psi )}\n\n constitutes a Parseval frame for \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L^{2}(\\mathbb {R} ^{2})}\n\n consisting of bandlimited functions.[5]\nAnother example are compactly supported shearlet systems, where a compactly supported function \n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\u2208\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\psi \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb {R} ^{2})}\n\n can be chosen so that \n\n\n\nSH\n\u2061\n(\n\u03c8\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\operatorname {SH} (\\psi )}\n\n forms a frame for \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L^{2}(\\mathbb {R} ^{2})}\n\n.[4][6][7][8] In this case, all shearlet elements in \n\n\n\nSH\n\u2061\n(\n\u03c8\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\operatorname {SH} (\\psi )}\n\n are compactly supported providing superior spatial localization compared to the classical shearlets, which are bandlimited. Although a compactly supported shearlet system does not generally form a Parseval frame, any function \n\n\n\nf\n\u2208\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f\\in L^{2}(\\mathbb {R} ^{2})}\n\n can be represented by the shearlet expansion due to its frame property.\nOne drawback of shearlets defined as above is the directional bias of shearlet elements associated with large shearing parameters. This effect is already recognizable in the frequency tiling of classical shearlets (see Figure in Section #Examples), where the frequency support of a shearlet increasingly aligns along the \n\n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi _{2}}\n\n-axis as the shearing parameter \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n goes to infinity. This causes serious problems when analyzing a function whose Fourier transform is concentrated around the \n\n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\xi _{2}}\n\n-axis.\nTo deal with this problem, the frequency domain is divided into a low-frequency part and two conic regions (see Figure):\nThe associated cone-adapted discrete shearlet system consists of three parts, each one corresponding to one of these frequency domains. It is generated by three functions \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n,\n\u03c8\n,\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n~\n\n\n\n\u2208\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi ,\\psi ,{\\tilde {\\psi }}\\in L^{2}(\\mathbb {R} ^{2})}\n\n and a lattice sampling factor \n\n\n\nc\n=\n(\n\nc\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\u2208\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n>\n0\n\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n:\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c=(c_{1},c_{2})\\in (\\mathbb {R} _{>0})^{2}:}\n\n\nwhere\nwith\nThe systems \n\n\n\n\u03a8\n(\n\u03c8\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Psi (\\psi )}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03a8\n~\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n~\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tilde {\\Psi }}({\\tilde {\\psi }})}\n\n basically differ in the reversed roles of \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{1}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{2}}\n\n.

Finally, the scaling function \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n is associated with the low-frequency part \n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {R}}}\n\n.",
