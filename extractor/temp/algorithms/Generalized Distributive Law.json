Aji and Robert J. McEliece with the same title.[1]\n\n\n\"The distributive law in mathematics is the law relating the operations of multiplication and addition, stated symbolically, \n\n\n\na\n\u2217\n(\nb\n+\nc\n)\n=\na\n\u2217\nb\n+\na\n\u2217\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a*(b+c)=a*b+a*c}\n\n; that is, the monomial factor \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n is distributed, or separately applied, to each term of the binomial factor \n\n\n\nb\n+\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b+c}\n\n, resulting in the product \n\n\n\na\n\u2217\nb\n+\na\n\u2217\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a*b+a*c}\n\n\" - Britannica[2]\nAs it can be observed from the definition, application of distributive law to an arithmetic expression reduces the number of operations in it. In the previous example the total number of operations reduced from three (two multiplications and an addition in \n\n\n\na\n\u2217\nb\n+\na\n\u2217\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a*b+a*c}\n\n) to two (one multiplication and one addition in \n\n\n\na\n\u2217\n(\nb\n+\nc\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a*(b+c)}\n\n). Generalization of distributive law leads to a large family of fast algorithms. This includes the FFT and Viterbi algorithm.\nThis is explained in a more formal way in the example below:\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n(\na\n,\n\nb\n)\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nd\ne\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nc\n,\nd\n,\ne\n\u2208\nA\n\n\nf\n(\na\n,\n\nc\n,\n\nb\n)\n\ng\n(\na\n,\n\nd\n,\n\ne\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha (a,\\,b){\\stackrel {\\mathrm {def} }{=}}\\displaystyle \\sum \\limits _{c,d,e\\in A}f(a,\\,c,\\,b)\\,g(a,\\,d,\\,e)}\n\n where \n\n\n\nf\n(\n\u22c5\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(\\cdot )}\n\n and \n\n\n\ng\n(\n\u22c5\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(\\cdot )}\n\n are real-valued functions, \n\n\n\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n,\nd\n,\ne\n\u2208\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a,b,c,d,e\\in A}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n|\n\nA\n\n|\n\n=\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |A|=q}\n\n (say)\nHere we are \"marginalizing out\" the independent variables (\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n, \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n, and \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n) to obtain the result.

This shows by an example that applying distributive law reduces the computational complexity which is one of the good features of a \"fast algorithm\".\nSome of the problems that used distributive law to solve can be grouped as follows\n1. Decoding algorithms\nA GDL like algorithm was used by Gallager's for decoding low density parity-check codes. Based on Gallager's work Tanner introduced the Tanner graph and expressed Gallagers work in message passing form. The tanners graph also helped explain the Viterbi algorithm.\nIt is observed by Forney that Viterbi's maximum likelihood decoding of convolutional codes also used algorithms of GDL-like generality.\n2. Forward-backward algorithm\nThe forward backward algorithm helped as an algorithm for tracking the states in the markov chain. And this also was used the algorithm of GDL like generality\n3. Artificial intelligence\nThe notion of junction trees has been used to solve many problems in AI. Also the concept of bucket elimination used many of the concepts.\nMPF or marginalize a product function is a general computational problem which as special case includes many classical problems such as computation of discrete Hadamard transform, maximum likelihood decoding of a linear code over a memory-less channel, and matrix chain multiplication. The power of the GDL lies in the fact that it applies to situations in which additions and multiplications are generalized. A commutative semiring is a good framework for explaining this behavior. It is defined over a set \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n with operators \"\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +}\n\n\" and \"\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle .}\n\n\" where \n\n\n\n(\nK\n,\n\n+\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (K,\\,+)}\n\n and \n\n\n\n(\nK\n,\n\n.\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (K,\\,.)}\n\n are a commutative monoids and the distributive law holds.\nLet \n\n\n\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\np\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p_{1},\\ldots ,p_{n}}\n\n be variables such that \n\n\n\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n\u2208\n\nA\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\np\n\nn\n\n\n\u2208\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p_{1}\\in A_{1},\\ldots ,p_{n}\\in A_{n}}\n\n where \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n is a finite set and \n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nA\n\ni\n\n\n\n|\n\n=\n\nq\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |A_{i}|=q_{i}}\n\n.

But however if add the two dummy domains as shown below then organizing the updated set into a junction tree would be possible and easy too.\n5.\n\n\n\n{\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{p_{1},p_{2}}\n\n,\n\n\n\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p_{4}\\}}\n\n\n6.\n\n\n\n{\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{p_{2},p_{3}}\n\n,\n\n\n\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p_{4}\\}}\n\n\nSimilarly for these set of domains, the junction tree looks like shown below:\nInput: A set of local domains.\nOutput: For the given set of domains, possible minimum number of operations that is required to solve the problem is computed.\nSo, if \n\n\n\n\nv\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{i}}\n\nand\n\n\n\n\nv\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{j}}\n\n are connected by an edge in the junction tree, then a message from \n\n\n\n\nv\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{i}}\n\n to \n\n\n\n\nv\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{j}}\n\n is a set/table of values given by a function: \n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu _{i,j}}\n\n:\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nS\n\ni\n\n\n\u2229\n\nS\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\u2192\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{S_{i}\\cap S_{j}}\\rightarrow R}\n\n.

Here messages are sent only in the direction towards the targeted vertex. Note that all the directed messages are sent only once. The messages are started from the leaf nodes(where the degree is 1) go up towards the target vertex \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{0}}\n\n. The message travels from the leaves to its parents and then from there to their parents and so on until it reaches the target vertex \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{0}}\n\n. The target vertex \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{0}}\n\n will compute its state only when it receives all messages from all its neighbors. Once we have the state, We have got the answer and hence the algorithm terminates.\nFor Example, Lets consider a junction tree constructed from the set of local domains given above i.e. the set from example 1,\nNow the Scheduling table for these domains is (where the target vertex is \n\n\n\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p_{2}}\n\n).\n\n\n\n\n\nRound                      Message or State Computation\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{Round                      Message or State Computation}}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\u03bc\n\n8\n,\n4\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03b1\n\n8\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1.\\mu _{8,4}(p_{4})=\\alpha _{8}(p_{4})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\u03bc\n\n8\n,\n4\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03a3\n\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n9\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2.\\mu _{8,4}(p_{4})=\\Sigma _{p_{2}}\\alpha _{9}(p_{2},p_{4})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\u03bc\n\n5\n,\n2\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03b1\n\n5\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 3.\\mu _{5,2}(p_{3})=\\alpha _{5}(p_{3})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\u03bc\n\n6\n,\n3\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03a3\n\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n6\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 4.\\mu _{6,3}(p_{1})=\\Sigma _{p_{4}}\\alpha _{6}(p_{1},p_{4})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\u03bc\n\n7\n,\n3\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03b1\n\n7\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 5.\\mu _{7,3}(p_{1})=\\alpha _{7}(p_{1})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\n\u03bc\n\n4\n,\n2\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03a3\n\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n4\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n,\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\u03bc\n\n8\n,\n4\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\u03bc\n\n9\n,\n4\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 6.\\mu _{4,2}(p_{3})=\\Sigma _{p_{4}}\\alpha _{4}(p_{3},p_{4}).\\mu _{8,4}(p_{4}).\\mu _{9,4}(p_{4})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\n\u03bc\n\n3\n,\n1\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03a3\n\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n3\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\u03bc\n\n6\n,\n3\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\u03bc\n\n7\n,\n3\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 7.\\mu _{3,1}(p_{2})=\\Sigma _{p_{1}}\\alpha _{3}(p_{2},p_{1}).\\mu _{6,3}(p_{1}).\\mu _{7,3}(p_{1})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n,\n1\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03a3\n\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n,\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\u03bc\n\n4\n,\n2\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\u03bc\n\n5\n,\n2\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 8.\\mu _{2,1}(p_{2})=\\Sigma _{p_{3}}\\alpha _{2}(p_{3},p_{2}).\\mu _{4,2}(p_{3}).\\mu _{5,2}(p_{3})}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\n\u03c3\n\n1\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n,\n1\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\u03bc\n\n3\n,\n1\n\n\n(\n\np\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 9.\\sigma _{1}(p_{2})=\\alpha _{1}(p_{2}).\\mu _{2,1}(p_{2}).\\mu _{3,1}(p_{2})}\n\n\nThus the complexity for Single Vertex GDL can be shown as\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03a3\n\nv\n\n\nd\n(\nv\n)\n\n|\n\n\nA\n\n\nS\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Sigma _{v}d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}|}\n\n arithmetic operations\nWhere (Note: The explanation for the above equation is explained later in the article )\n\n\n\n\nS\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(v)}\n\n is the label of \n\n\n\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v}\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nd\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d(v)}\n\n is the degree of \n\n\n\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v}\n\n (i.e. number of vertices adjacent to v).\nTo solve the All-Vertices problem, we can schedule GDL in several ways, some of them are parallel implementation where in each round, every state is updated and every message is computed and transmitted at the same time.

The optimization obtained by the use of these trees is comparable to the optimization obtained by solving a semi group problem on trees. For example, to find the minimum of a group of numbers we can observe that if we have a tree and the elements are all at the bottom of the tree, then we can compare the minimum of two items in parallel and the resultant minimum will be written to the parent. When this process is propagated up the tree the minimum of the group of elements will be found at the root.\nThe following is the complexity for solving the junction tree using message passing\nWe rewrite the formula used earlier to the following form.

(Here by direct method we mean by methods that do not use message passing. The time taken using the direct method will be the equivalent to calculating message at each node and time to calculate the state of each of the nodes.)\nNow we consider the all-vertex problem where the message will have to be sent in both the directions and state must be computed at both the vertexes.

But even in cases where there are cycles and a number of iterations the messages will approximately be equal to the objective function. The experiments on Gallager\u2013Tanner\u2013Wiberg algorithm for low density parity-check codes were supportive of this claim.",
