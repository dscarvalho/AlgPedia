A base and a strong generating set (together often called a BSGS) for a group can be obtained using the Schreier\u2013Sims algorithm.[2]\nIt is often beneficial to deal with bases and strong generating sets as these may be easier to work with than the entire group. A group may have a small base compared to the set it acts on. In the \"worst case\", the symmetric groups and alternating groups have large bases (the symmetric group Sn has base size n \u2212 1), and there are often specialized algorithms that deal with these cases.\n",
