There is an IDE called FreeFem++-cs.\n\n\nThe first version was created in 1987 by Olivier Pironneau, and it was named MacFem (it only worked on Macintosh); PCFem appeared some time later. Both were written in Pascal.\nIn 1992 it was re-written in C++ and it was named FreeFem. Later versions, FreeFem+ (1996) and FreeFem++ (1998) used that programming language too.\nDeprecated versions:",
