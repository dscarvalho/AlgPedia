    "about": "In numerical analysis, order of accuracy quantifies the rate of convergence of a numerical approximation of a differential equation to the exact solution. A numerical solution to a differential equation is said to be \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\nth-order accurate if the error, \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n, is proportional to the step-size \n\n\n\nh\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h}\n\n to the \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\nth power;[1]",
