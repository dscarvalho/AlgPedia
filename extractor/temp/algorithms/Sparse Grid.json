Smolyak, a student of Lazar Lyusternik, and are based on a sparse tensor product construction. Computer algorithms for efficient implementations of such grids were later developed by Michael Griebel and Christoph Zenger.\nThe standard way of representing multidimensional functions are tensor or full grids. The number of basis functions or nodes (grid points) that have to be stored and processed depend exponentially on the number of dimensions. Even with today's computational power it is not possible to process functions with more than 4 or 5 dimensions.\nThe curse of dimension is expressed in the order of the integration error that is made by a quadrature of level \n\n\n\nl\n\n\n{\\displaystyle l}\n\n, with \n\n\n\n\nN\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N_{l}}\n\n points. The function has regularity \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n, i.e. is \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n times differentiable.
