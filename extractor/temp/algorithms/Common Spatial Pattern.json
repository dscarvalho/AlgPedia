Otherwize CSP optimizes the ratio of second-order moment.\nThis method can be applied to several multivariate signal but it seems that most works on it concern electroencephalographic signals.\nParticularly, the method is mostly used on brain\u2013computer interface in order to retrieve the component signal which best transduce the cerebral activity for a specific task (e.g. hand movement).[4]\nIt can also be used to separate artifacts from electroencephalographics signals.[2]\nAn adaptation of the common spatial pattern for event-related potentials has been formalized in [5].\n",
