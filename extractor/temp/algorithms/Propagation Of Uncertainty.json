    "full_text": "In statistics, propagation of uncertainty (or propagation of error) is the effect of variables' uncertainties (or errors, more specifically random errors) on the uncertainty of a function based on them. When the variables are the values of experimental measurements they have uncertainties due to measurement limitations (e.g., instrument precision) which propagate to the combination of variables in the function.\nThe uncertainty u can be expressed in a number of ways. It may be defined by the absolute error \u0394x. Uncertainties can also be defined by the relative error (\u0394x)/x, which is usually written as a percentage. Most commonly, the uncertainty on a quantity is quantified in terms of the standard deviation, \u03c3, the positive square root of variance, \u03c32. The value of a quantity and its error are then expressed as an interval x \u00b1 u. If the statistical probability distribution of the variable is known or can be assumed, it is possible to derive confidence limits to describe the region within which the true value of the variable may be found. For example, the 68% confidence limits for a one-dimensional variable belonging to a normal distribution are approximately \u00b1 one standard deviation \u03c3 from the central value x, which means that the region x \u00b1 \u03c3 will cover the true value in roughly 68% of cases.\nIf the uncertainties are correlated then covariance must be taken into account. Correlation can arise from two different sources. First, the measurement errors may be correlated. Second, when the underlying values are correlated across a population, the uncertainties in the group averages will be correlated.[1]\n\n\nLet \n\n\n\n{\n\nf\n\nk\n\n\n(\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n)\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{f_{k}(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots ,x_{n})\\}}\n\n be a set of m functions which are linear combinations of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n variables \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\dots ,x_{n}}\n\n with combination coefficients \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nk\n1\n\n\n,\n\nA\n\nk\n2\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nA\n\nk\nn\n\n\n,\n(\nk\n=\n1\n\u2026\nm\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{k1},A_{k2},\\dots ,A_{kn},(k=1\\dots m)}\n\n.\nand let the variance-covariance matrix on x be denoted by \n\n\n\n\n\n\u03a3\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {\\Sigma ^{x}} \\,}\n\n.\nThen, the variance-covariance matrix \n\n\n\n\n\n\u03a3\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {\\Sigma ^{f}} \\,}\n\n of f is given by\nor, in matrix notation:\nThis is the most general expression for the propagation of error from one set of variables onto another.

In a probabilistic approach, the function f must usually be linearized by approximation to a first-order Taylor series expansion, though in some cases, exact formulas can be derived that do not depend on the expansion as is the case for the exact variance of products.[2] The Taylor expansion would be:\nwhere \n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nf\n\nk\n\n\n\n/\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\partial f_{k}/\\partial x_{i}}\n\n denotes the partial derivative of fk with respect to the i-th variable, evaluated at the mean value of all components of vector x.

Then\nor\nError estimates for non-linear functions are biased on account of using a truncated series expansion. The extent of this bias depends on the nature of the function. For example, the bias on the error calculated for log\u00a0x increases as x increases, since the expansion to 1\u00a0+\u00a0x is a good approximation only when x is small.\nFor highly non-linear functions, there exist five categories of probabilistic approaches for uncertainty propagation;[6] see Uncertainty Quantification#Methodologies for forward uncertainty propagation for details.\nIn the special case of the inverse or reciprocal \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/B}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nB\n=\nN\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B=N(0,1)}\n\n, the distribution is a reciprocal normal distribution, and there is no definable variance. For such inverse distributions and for ratio distributions, there can be defined probabilities for intervals, which can be computed either by Monte Carlo simulation or, in some cases, by using the Geary\u2013Hinkley transformation.[7]\nThe statistics, mean and variance, of the shifted reciprocal function \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\np\n\u2212\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{p-B}}}\n\n for \n\n\n\nB\n=\nN\n(\n\u03bc\n,\n\u03c3\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B=N(\\mu ,\\sigma )}\n\n, however, exist in a principal value sense if the difference between the shift or pole \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n and the mean \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu }\n\n is real.
