    "about": "The BCJR algorithm is an algorithm for maximum a posteriori decoding of error correcting codes defined on trellises (principally convolutional codes). The algorithm is named after its inventors: Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek and Raviv.[1] This algorithm is critical to modern iteratively-decoded error-correcting codes including turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes.",
