    "full_text": "The Kantorovich theorem is a mathematical statement on the convergence of Newton's method. It was first stated by Leonid Kantorovich in 1940.\nNewton's method constructs a sequence of points that under certain conditions will converge to a solution \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n of an equation \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)=0}\n\n or a vector solution of a system of equation \n\n\n\nF\n(\nx\n)\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F(x)=0}\n\n. The Kantorovich theorem gives conditions on the initial point of this sequence. If those conditions are satisfied then a solution exists close to the initial point and the sequence converges to that point.\n\n\nLet \n\n\n\nX\n\u2282\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X\\subset \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n\n be an open subset and \n\n\n\nF\n:\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2283\nX\n\u2192\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F:\\mathbb {R} ^{n}\\supset X\\to \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n\n a differentiable function with a Jacobian \n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\u2032\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F^{\\prime }(x)}\n\n that is locally Lipschitz continuous (for instance if \n\n\n\nF\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F}\n\n is twice differentiable). That is, it is assumed that for any open subset \n\n\n\nU\n\u2282\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle U\\subset X}\n\n there exists a constant \n\n\n\nL\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L>0}\n\n such that for any \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n,\n\ny\n\n\u2208\nU\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} ,\\mathbf {y} \\in U}\n\n\nholds. The norm on the left is some operator norm that is compatible with the vector norm on the right. This inequality can be rewritten to only use the vector norm.
