    "full_text": "It was observed in evolution strategies that significant progress toward the fitness/objective function's optimum, generally, can only happen in a narrow band of the mutation step size \u03c3. That narrow band is called evolution window.\nThere are three well-known methods to adapt the mutation step size \u03c3 in evolution strategies:\nOn simple functions all of them have been empirically shown to keep the step size within the evolution window.",
