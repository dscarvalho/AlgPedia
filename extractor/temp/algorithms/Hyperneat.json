    "about": "Hypercube-based NEAT, or HyperNEAT,[1] is a generative encoding that evolves artificial neural networks (ANNs) with the principles of the widely used NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) algorithm.[2] It is a novel technique for evolving large-scale neural networks using the geometric regularities of the task domain. It uses Compositional Pattern Producing Networks [3] (CPPNs), which are used to generate the images for Picbreeder.org and shapes for EndlessForms.com. HyperNEAT has recently been extended to also evolve plastic ANNs [4] and to evolve the location of every neuron in the network.[5]",
