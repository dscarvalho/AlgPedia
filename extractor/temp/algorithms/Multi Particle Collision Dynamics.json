The same rotation is applied for all particles within a given collision cell, but the direction (axis) of rotation is statistically independent both between all cells and for a given cell in time.\nIf the structure of the collision grid defined by the positions of the collision cells is fixed, Galilean invariance is violated. It is restored with the introduction of a random shift of the collision grid.[4]\nExplicit expressions for the diffusion coefficient and viscosity derived based on Green-Kubo relations are in excellent agreement with simulations.[5][6]\nThe set of parameters for the simulation of the solvent are:\nThe simulation parameters define the solvent properties,[1] such as\nwhere \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n is the dimensionality of the system.\nA typical choice for normalisation is \n\n\n\na\n=\n1\n,\n\nk\nT\n=\n1\n,\n\nm\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a=1,\\;kT=1,\\;m=1}\n\n.
