    "about": "The spectral test is a statistical test for the quality of a class of pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), the linear congruential generators (LCGs).[1] LCGs have a property that when plotted in 2 or more dimensions, lines or hyperplanes will form, on which all possible outputs can be found. The spectral test compares the distance between these planes; the further apart they are, the worse the generator is.[2] As this test is devised to study the lattice structures of LCGs, it can not be applied to other families of PRNGs.",

The IBM subroutine RANDU[4] LCG fails in this test for 3 dimensions and above.\n\n",
