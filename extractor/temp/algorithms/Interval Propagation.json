The main theory that is used to build atomic contractors are based on interval analysis.\nExample. Consider for instance the equation\nwhich involves the three variables x1,x2 and x3.\nThe associated contractor is given by the following statements\nFor instance, if\nthe contractor performs the following calculus\nFor other constraints, a specific algorithm for implementing the atomic contractor should be written. An illustration is the atomic contractor associated to the equation\nis provided by Figures 1 and 2.\nFor more complex constraints, a decomposition into atomic constraints (i.e., constraints for which an atomic contractor exists) should be performed. Consider for instance the constraint\ncould be decomposed into\nThe interval domains that should be associated to the new intermediate variables are\nThe principle of the interval propagation is to call all available atomic contractors until no more contraction could be observed. [2] As a result of the Knaster-Tarski theorem, the procedure always converges to intervals which enclose all feasible values for the variables. A formalization of the interval propagation can be made thanks to the contractor algebra. Interval propagation converges quickly to the result and can deal with problems involving several hundred of variables.
