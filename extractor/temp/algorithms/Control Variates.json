It exploits information about the errors in estimates of known quantities to reduce the error of an estimate of an unknown quantity.[1]\n\n\nLet the unknown parameter of interest be \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu }\n\n, and assume we have a statistic \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n such that the expected value of m is \u03bc: \n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n[\nm\n]\n\n=\n\u03bc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {E} \\left[m\\right]=\\mu }\n\n, i.e. m is an unbiased estimator for \u03bc.
