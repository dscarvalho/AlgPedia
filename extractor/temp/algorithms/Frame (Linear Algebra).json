There are some problems with this plan:\nLet V be an inner product space and \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n}\n\nk\n\u2208\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {e} _{k}\\}_{k\\in \\mathbb {N} }}\n\n be a set of vectors in \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V}\n\n. These vectors satisfy the frame condition if there are positive real numbers A and B such that A \u2264 B and for each \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} }\n\n in V,\nA set of vectors that satisfies the frame condition is a frame for the vector space.[3]\nThe numbers A and B are called the lower and upper frame bounds, respectively.[3] The frame bounds are not unique because numbers less than A and greater than B are also valid frame bounds. The optimal lower bound is the supremum of all lower bounds and the optimal upper bound is the infimum of all upper bounds.\nA frame is overcomplete (or redundant) if it is not a basis for the vector space.\nBecause of the various mathematical components surrounding frames, frame theory has roots in harmonic and functional analysis, operator theory, linear algebra, and matrix theory.[4]\nThe Fourier transform has been used for over a century as a way of decomposing and expanding signals. However, the Fourier transform masks key information regarding the moment of emission and the duration of a signal. In 1946, Dennis Gabor was able to solve this using a technique that simultaneously reduced noise, provided resiliency, and created quantization while encapsulating important signal characteristics.[1] This discovery marked the first concerted effort towards frame theory.\nThe frame condition was first described by Richard Duffin and Albert Charles Schaeffer in a 1952 article on nonharmonic Fourier series as a way of computing the coefficients in a linear combination of the vectors of a linearly dependent spanning set (in their terminology, a \"Hilbert space frame\").[5] In the 1980s, St\u00e9phane Mallat, Ingrid Daubechies, and Mayer used frames to analyze wavelets. Today frames are associated with wavelets, signal and image processing, and data compression.\nA frame satisfies a generalization of Parseval's identity, namely the frame condition, while still maintaining norm equivalence between a signal and its sequence of coefficients.\nIf the set \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {e} _{k}\\}}\n\n is a frame of V, it spans V. Otherwise there would exist at least one non-zero \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\u2208\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} \\in V}\n\n which would be orthogonal to all \n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {e} _{k}}\n\n. If we insert \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} }\n\n into the frame condition, we obtain\ntherefore \n\n\n\nA\n\u2264\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A\\leq 0}\n\n, which is a violation of the initial assumptions on the lower frame bound.\nIf a set of vectors spans V, this is not a sufficient condition for calling the set a frame. As an example, consider \n\n\n\nV\n=\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V=\\mathbb {R} ^{2}}\n\n with the dot product, and the infinite set \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {e} _{k}\\}}\n\n given by\nThis set spans V but since \n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n|\n\u27e8\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n,\n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\n\u27e9\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n+\n1\n+\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n3\n\n\n+\n\u22ef\n=\n\u221e\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sum _{k}\\left|\\langle \\mathbf {e} _{k},(0,1)\\rangle \\right|^{2}=0+1+{\\frac {1}{2}}+{\\frac {1}{3}}+\\dotsb =\\infty }\n\n, we cannot choose a finite upper frame bound B. Consequently, the set \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {e} _{k}\\}}\n\n is not a frame.\nIn signal processing, each vector is interpreted as a signal. In this interpretation, a vector expressed as a linear combination of the frame vectors is a redundant signal. Using a frame, it is possible to create a simpler, more sparse representation of a signal as compared with a family of elementary signals (that is, representing a signal strictly with a set of linearly independent vectors may not always be the most compact form).[6] Frames, therefore, provide robustness. Because they provide a way of producing the same vector within a space, signals can be encoded in various ways. This facilitates fault tolerance and resilience to a loss of signal. Finally, redundancy can be used to mitigate noise, which is relevant to the restoration, enhancement, and reconstruction of signals.\nIn signal processing, it is common to assume the vector space is a Hilbert space.\nA frame is a tight frame if A = B; in other words, the frame satisfies a generalized version of Parseval's identity. For example, the union of k orthonormal bases of a vector space is a tight frame with A = B = k. A tight frame is a Parseval frame (sometimes called a normalized frame) if A = B = 1. Each orthonormal basis is a Parseval frame, but the converse is not always true.\nA frame is an equal norm frame (sometimes called a uniform frame or a normalized frame) if there is a constant c such that \n\n\n\n\u2225\n\ne\n\ni\n\n\n\u2225\n=\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\|e_{i}\\|=c}\n\n for each i. An equal norm frame is a unit norm frame if c = 1. A Parseval (or tight) unit norm frame is an orthonormal basis; such a frame satisfies Parseval's identity.\nA frame is an equiangular frame if there is a constant c such that \n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u27e8\n\ne\n\ni\n\n\n,\n\ne\n\nj\n\n\n\u27e9\n\n|\n\n=\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |\\langle e_{i},e_{j}\\rangle |=c}\n\n for each distinct i and j.\nA frame is an exact frame if no proper subset of the frame spans the inner product space. Each basis for an inner product space is an exact frame for the space (so a basis is a special case of a frame).\nA bessel sequence is a set of vectors that satisfies only the upper bound of the frame condition.\nThe frame condition entails the existence of a set of dual frame vectors \n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n\ne\n~\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {\\tilde {e}} _{k}\\}}\n\n with the property that\nfor any \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\u2208\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} \\in V}\n\n. This implies that a frame together with its dual frame has the same property as a basis and its dual basis in terms of reconstructing a vector from scalar products.\nIn order to construct a dual frame, we first need the linear mapping \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n:\nV\n\u2192\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {S} :V\\rightarrow V}\n\n, called the frame operator, defined as\nFrom this definition of \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {S} }\n\n and linearity in the first argument of the inner product,\nwhich, when substituted in the frame condition inequality, yields\nfor each \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\u2208\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} \\in V}\n\n.\nThe frame operator \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {S} }\n\n is self-adjoint, positive definite, and has positive upper and lower bounds. The inverse \n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {S} ^{-1}}\n\n of \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {S} }\n\n exists and it, too, is self-adjoint, positive definite, and has positive upper and lower bounds.\nThe dual frame is defined by mapping each element of the frame with \n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {S} ^{-1}}\n\n:\nTo see that this makes sense, let \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} }\n\n be an element of \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V}\n\n and let\nThus\nwhich proves that\nAlternatively, we can let\nBy inserting the above definition of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n~\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tilde {\\mathbf {e} }}_{k}}\n\n and applying the properties of \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {S} }\n\n and its inverse,\nwhich shows that\nThe numbers \n\n\n\n\u27e8\n\nv\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n~\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\u27e9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle \\mathbf {v} ,{\\tilde {\\mathbf {e} }}_{k}\\rangle }\n\n are called frame coefficients. This derivation of a dual frame is a summary of Section 3 in the article by Duffin and Schaeffer.[5] They use the term conjugate frame for what here is called a dual frame.\nThe dual frame \n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n~\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{{\\tilde {\\mathbf {e} }}_{k}\\}}\n\n is called the canonical dual of \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {e} _{k}\\}}\n\n because it acts similarly as a dual basis to a basis.\nWhen the frame \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {e} _{k}\\}}\n\n is overcomplete, a vector \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} }\n\n can be written as a linear combination of \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {e} _{k}\\}}\n\n in more than one way. That is, there are different choices of coefficients \n\n\n\n{\n\nc\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{c_{k}\\}}\n\n such that \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n\n\n\nc\n\nk\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} =\\sum _{k}c_{k}\\mathbf {e} _{k}}\n\n. This allows us some freedom for the choice of coefficients \n\n\n\n{\n\nc\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{c_{k}\\}}\n\n other than \n\n\n\n\u27e8\n\nv\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n~\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\u27e9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle \\mathbf {v} ,{\\tilde {\\mathbf {e} }}_{k}\\rangle }\n\n. It is necessary that the frame \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ne\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {e} _{k}\\}}\n\n is overcomplete for other such coefficients \n\n\n\n{\n\nc\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{c_{k}\\}}\n\n to exist. If so, then there exist frames \n\n\n\n{\n\n\ng\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\u2260\n{\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n~\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathbf {g} _{k}\\}\\neq \\{{\\tilde {\\mathbf {e} }}_{k}\\}}\n\n for which\nfor all \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\u2208\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} \\in V}\n\n.
