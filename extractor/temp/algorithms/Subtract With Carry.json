S and R satisfy the condition \n\n\n\n0\n<\nS\n<\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0<S<R}\n\n. Modulus M has the value \n\n\n\nM\n=\n\n2\n\nW\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M=2^{W}}\n\n, where W is the word size, in bits, of the state sequence and \n\n\n\nW\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W>0}\n\n.\nThe subtract-with-carry engine is one of the family of generators which includes as well add-with-carry and subtract-with-borrow engines.[1]",
