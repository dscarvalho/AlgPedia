It arises naturally in design of experiments.[1]:71\u201372\nThere is a group of subjects. Each subject has several features, which are considered binary. For example: each subject can be either young or old; either black or white; either tall or short; etc. The goal is to divide the subjects to two sub-groups: treatment group (T) and control group (C), such that for each feature, the number of subjects that have this feature in T is roughly equal to the number of subjects that have this feature in C. E.g., both groups should have roughly the same number of young people, the same number of black people, the same number of tall people, etc.\nFormally, the set balancing problem can be described as follows.\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n is the number of subjects in the general population.\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n is the number of potential features.\nThe subjects are described by \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n, an \n\n\n\nn\n\u00d7\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\times m}\n\n matrix with entries in \n\n\n\n\n0\n,\n1\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {0,1}}\n\n. Each column represents a subject and each row represents a feature. \n\n\n\n\na\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{i,j}=1}\n\n if subject \n\n\n\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle j}\n\n has feature \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n, and \n\n\n\n\na\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{i,j}=0}\n\n if subject \n\n\n\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle j}\n\n does not have feature \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n.\nThe partition to groups is described by \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n, an \n\n\n\nm\n\u00d7\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m\\times 1}\n\n vector with entries in \n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n,\n1\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {-1,1}}\n\n. \n\n\n\n\nb\n\nj\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b_{j}=1}\n\n if subject \n\n\n\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle j}\n\n is in the treatment group T and \n\n\n\n\nb\n\nj\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b_{j}=-1}\n\n is subject \n\n\n\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle j}\n\n is in the control group C.\nThe balance of features is described by \n\n\n\nc\n=\nA\n\u22c5\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c=A\\cdot b}\n\n. This is an \n\n\n\nn\n\u00d7\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\times 1}\n\n vector. The numeric value of \n\n\n\n\nc\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{i}}\n\n is the imbalance in feature \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n: if \n\n\n\n\nc\n\ni\n\n\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{i}>0}\n\n then there are more subjects with \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n in T and if \n\n\n\n\nc\n\ni\n\n\n<\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{i}<0}\n\n then there are more subjects with \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n in C.\nThe imbalance of a given partition is defined as:\nThe set balancing problem is to find a vector \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n which minimizes the imbalance \n\n\n\nI\n(\nb\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I(b)}\n\n.\nAn approximate solution can be found with the following very simple randomized algorithm:\nIn matrix formulation:\nSurprisingly, although this algorithm completely ignores the matrix \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n, it achieves a small imbalance with high probability when there are many features. Formally, for a random vector \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n:\nPROOF:\nLet \n\n\n\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{i}}\n\n be the total number of subjects that have feature \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n (equivalently, the number of ones in the \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th of the matrix \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n). Consider the following two cases:\nEasy case: \n\n\n\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n\u2264\n\n\n4\nm\nln\n\u2061\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{i}\\leq {\\sqrt {4m\\ln n}}}\n\n. Then, with probability 1, the imbalance in feature \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n (that we marked by \n\n\n\n\nc\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{i}}\n\n) is at most \n\n\n\n\n\n4\nm\nln\n\u2061\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {4m\\ln n}}}\n\n.\nHard case: \n\n\n\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n>\n\n\n4\nm\nln\n\u2061\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{i}>{\\sqrt {4m\\ln n}}}\n\n. For every \n\n\n\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle j}\n\n, let \n\n\n\n\nX\n\nj\n\n\n=\n\na\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\nb\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{j}=a_{i,j}b_{j}}\n\n. Each such \n\n\n\n\nX\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{j}}\n\n is a random variable that can be either 1 or -1 with probability 1/2. The imbalance in feature \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n is: \n\n\n\n\nc\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n=\n1\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{i}=\\sum _{j=1}^{m}{X_{j}}}\n\n. Since the \n\n\n\n\nX\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{j}}\n\n are independent random variables, by the Chernoff bound, for every \n\n\n\na\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a>0}\n\n:\nSelect: \n\n\n\na\n=\n\n\n4\nm\nln\n\u2061\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a={\\sqrt {4m\\ln n}}}\n\n and get:\nBy the union bound,",
