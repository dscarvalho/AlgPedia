    "about": "The Beaufort cipher, created by Sir Francis Beaufort, is a substitution cipher similar to the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, with a slightly modified enciphering mechanism and tableau.[1] Its most famous application was in a rotor-based cipher machine, the Hagelin M-209.[2] The Beaufort cipher is based on the Beaufort square which is essentially the same as a Vigen\u00e8re square but in reverse order starting with the letter \"Z\" in the first row,[3] where the first row and the last column serve the same purpose.[4]",

    "full_text": "The Beaufort cipher, created by Sir Francis Beaufort, is a substitution cipher similar to the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, with a slightly modified enciphering mechanism and tableau.[1] Its most famous application was in a rotor-based cipher machine, the Hagelin M-209.[2] The Beaufort cipher is based on the Beaufort square which is essentially the same as a Vigen\u00e8re square but in reverse order starting with the letter \"Z\" in the first row,[3] where the first row and the last column serve the same purpose.[4]\n\n\nTo encrypt, first choose the plaintext character from the top row of the tableau, call this column P. Secondly, travel down column P to the corresponding key Letter K. Finally, move directly left from the Key letter to the left edge of the tableau, the CipherText encryption of Plaintext P with Key K will be there.\nFor example if encrypting Plain text character \"d\" with Key \"m\" the steps would be:\nTo decrypt, the process is reversed. The Beaufort cipher is a reciprocal cipher, that is, Decryption and Encryption algorithms are the same.\nDue to the similarities between the Beaufort cipher and the Vigen\u00e8re cipher it is possible, after applying a transformation, to solve it as a Vigen\u00e8re cipher. By replacing every letter in the ciphertext with its opposite letter (such that 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y' etc.) it can be solved like a Vigen\u00e8re cipher.\nThe Beaufort cipher should not be confused with the \"variant Beaufort\" cipher. In variant Beaufort, encryption is performed by performing the decryption step of the standard Vigen\u00e8re cipher, and likewise decryption is performed by using Vigen\u00e8re encryption.\n",
